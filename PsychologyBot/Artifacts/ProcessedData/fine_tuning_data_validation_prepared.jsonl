There are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition. If all physical and mental health issues are ruled out, it is time to take action. Get backup from friends or family members if you need to, but let your daughter know you are giving her 30 days notice. She needs to find another place to live within that time. If she wants to stay with you, be clear that first she has to go, with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time. Once out, she can prove to you, and more importantly to herself, that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment. Remember, you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful; if she is in good health, her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her. END"}

It is not unusual to experience feelings that do not seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes.In this case, it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you \"annoying and bothersome.\" Despite knowing that people like you, it seems that there is still a part of you that feels like you are a bother.Finding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need.

{"prompt":"My grandma had a stroke and passed away recently. I lost my home and job. I am looking but have not found a job. I have been binge watching television and binge eating.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wow, you got hit with some serious stuff all at once. Work, relationships, and housing\/security are major needs for us and to lose all that at once has got to affect you. When things go wrong, it is natural for us to look for blame----and the easiest person for us to blame is ourselves. Put that with grief and you have got a recipe for feeling awful. We can start feeling so low as to want to check out with things like food, and TV as you described. It can take time for us to move to self-forgiveness, and self-kindness in order to start moving forward again. I wonder what you can do right now to improve your situation? I also wonder if you may be willing to seek counseling to help you work through some of this, to help with your perspective, and to assist in your grieving process. Just reading these 3 sentences, I get the sense of you being a nice person. I hope you can show that kind of kindness to yourself in your healing. END"}

Somehow it is still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi, I am Amelia! Oh, this is a common problem, unfortunately! Let me say first of all, that doing more, giving more, loving more, performing more will never provide you with a sense of worth. Nor will it satisfy those that are critical and judgmental. I am so sorry to hear that this is what you have heard all your life! You are a human BEING not a human DOING.If you can get yourself in counseling with a trusted therapist who will accept you, encourage you, hear you and support you, you can begin to work on what truth worth is.

{"prompt":"I have a mother who is still running my life even though I am almost 30 years old. I want to move out and live my own life, but it feels like as long as I do what my mom wants our relationship is okay. It is never okay if I do not do what she wants. \n\nI do not know how to start making my own decisions and not worry about  whether it is right in her eyes.  Would it help for me to talk to someone about this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels \"okay\" is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life, then this only seems ok.In fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done, does not have their own ability to think for themselves.Separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters, from your mother's point of view, may be difficult.First, realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourself.You will need practice until you feel comfortable.Unless, if you have been thinking through decisions you would like to make and the idea of your mother's anger is the only point which stopped you, then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own life.Basically, it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best. Be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest. END"}

I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many possible answers to your question.The best one will be the one you decide after reflecting on your own reasoning as to your sexual attraction change.Sometimes people inhibit their sexuality because of fear others will disapprove. Currently since in most circles being gay is acceptable, the conditions are much easier now to come out.Maybe this describes you.How happy are you in your marriage?Sometimes people find it easier to discover a sudden change in their sexuality than to face painful emotions in an existing marriage.These are only two theoretical possibilities and may not even reflect your own.What matters is your self-discovery and that you trust your findings as the answer to your question.

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For a therapist, deciding to end counseling sessions or terminate working with a client is a thoughtful and intentional decision. One that is not entered into lightly.While there are many considerations counselors take into account, to help answer this question, I will offer an example of two areas that counselor's take into consideration when ending counseling sessions:Does the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide? This requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is needed.And, has the therapeutic relationship reached treatment goal(s)?While this question is specific to the counselor, I would like to also add that a client, at any time, can end counseling.

My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister.

I do not have a job, my family does not include me in anything, and I do not have many friends. I have nothing to do besides go on my phone. I miss talking to people in person instead of online. I do not even talk to my family in person even from the other room.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you are feeling pretty stuck, lonely, and hopeless; like you have a desire to be more connected to people and to find purpose in life, but are not sure what to do. I am glad to hear that you have at least one friend and I think it is great that you are reaching out for more connection. If you can, working with a therapist who is competent in treating depression may be a huge benefit to you and help you to regain a sense of meaning, motivation, and connection. Additionally, anything you can do to give yourself a little break from the feeling of pointlessness and any ruminating thoughts you may be having may be of help. I know it may sound pointless in the moment, and you may feel a great deal of inertia in doing so, but you may find that if you force yourself to do something small that is pleasurable, like taking a walk for example, there is a good chance you will be glad that you did so after the fact.

{"prompt":"My ex-wife married and used me to have a child. She now uses that child as a pawn. I know my child misses me, but I need to move on and not live in the past. How do I do this? Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You are in a difficult situation and on behalf of you and your child, I commend you for trying to find the right thing to do.Short version: your child needs you as much as possible. period. Always. We used to think that children were almost always harmed by divorce, unless there was extreme conflict or violence. More recent data shows that children are not necessarily harmed by divorce if they keep both their parents. In other words, the damaging part is losing half of themselves and losing the value of being connected to everyone who loves them, especially the other parent, in addition to the extra benefit there is from the other parent's perspective, strengths and so on.The best thing for your child is for you to be available and loving and doing everything possible to allow the child to be whole - a person who incorporates BOTH parents. It is a tragedy for everyone to use a child to achieve adult aims, like getting back at a former spouse. In such a circumstance, your child needs you more than ever. If you and your wife have different rules and so on, your child will learn to adjust and adapt, just as they would if you remained in the household. A child quickly learns that they talk to mom about x,y,z or get away with whatever, but has different rules with dad. He\/she will not be too confused in the long run.Please stay the course in dealing with a difficult ex-wife for you and your child's wellbeing. Best of luck to all. END"}
{"prompt":"How does a person start the counseling process?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Great question. The decision to pursue therapy can be a very difficult one and the fact that there seem to be so many profiles that you have to wade through can be particularly daunting. Here is what I suggest to make the process a bit easier:1) Narrow down your preferred geographical area. Are you in a rural, suburban, or urban environment? If it is either of the latter two, you will probably have a mental health professional close by. Decide now if it is important to you that their office be within walking or short driving distance.2) Decide if you need it to be covered by your insurance. You will have more options if you are willing to pay out of pocket and get reimbursed by your insurance, but more and more people are accepting insurance these days.3) Find someone whose profile has the key words that you are looking for. If you are struggling with traumatic flashbacks, make sure they have \"trauma\" or something along those lines in their profile.4) Make sure they have a friendly and professional picture. This is small, but this detail shows that they really care about how they present to the world.5) Come up with a list of about 3 people and rank them from most appealing to least. Set up an appointment with the person who seems like the best fit and give it a try for the first session. You will know by the end of it if it is a good fit.It can be scary, but finding the perfect fit makes it so worth it. Good luck! END"}
{"prompt":"I am married, but I had sex with my friend. I feel guilty, but I feel not guilty too. Do I need to feel guilty? It is my body, and I have full rights to do what I like.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I do not think there is anything that you are supposed to feel. Some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat, and others not at all. It could be that your partner does not know about the cheating and you have not had to face his\/her emotions and reactions. When something we do is hidden...a secret...it is easier to avoid feeling guilty. I wonder if you are avoiding your own emotions. But let us put that question aside for now. There are better questions.What do you want? Do you want your marriage? If not, this may be why you do not feel guilty.Do you want to be able to sleep with your friend? It is unlikely that both are possible (keeping the marriage and the affair). Yes, you get to do whatever you want with your body...and...there may be consequences. Affairs almost always get discovered.Who do you want to be? What kind of partner do you want to be? What might your partner feel if they knew? How might you feel then? Would you care? Has something happened that is affected how much you care about your partner?I suggest that these other questions might be a place to start. Exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe. I wish you the best as you sort it out. :) END"}

It is possible there is more suffering within you than you have realized until now.As you address all the emotional pain you have lived through, the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own. Because you would be focused on you, not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband. END"}

I really want to work up the courage to lose my fear.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Change can be uncomfortable, but sometimes those uncomfortable moments are the opportunity for us to be the person we feel we really are. It sounds like you like to spend the time in your head anticipating the worst, why not be in the present and encourage yourself that you can talk to people and it will be okay. By telling yourself it will not be okay, or that it will go wrong you are hurting your confidence to do what you want. Give yourself some credit for being awesome and tell yourself you can build new friendships...it may be the motivation you need to move past this fear. END"}
{"prompt":"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we have been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others.

I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship. There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work.Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other.That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband. It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you are willing to tolerate and the reason you are willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband does not start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.

I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably is not her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When you feel the frustration and anger building inside you have that be a trigger for you to remember a feeling that you want to experience instead of anger, frustration and guilt, for example understanding. Then say that word to yourself as you take deep breaths. But know that this is normal for caregivers\/family members to have these reactions because it is also an emotional roller coaster for you. Even though it is normal it is still good to try to respond differentyl and I commend you for doing that. You also may want to look for a Caregiver Support group which will help you hear from others who also respond this way. END"}
{"prompt":"I have a really bad temper. I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day. I do not mean to be that way, but I cannot help it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves. A surface situation, like, a store told you they would have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store does not have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it.If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life, the relationship did not allow for honest expression of all your emotions, you would have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly.Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone, eventually the person, possibly you, learned to contain and contain your emotions.It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately, are muting hurt feelings that you have understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history, to not talk about.As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger, take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear, are really the underlying source of your upset.I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions!

{"prompt":"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she did not have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello! Thank you for your question. I have a worked with many people who have become addicted to benzodiazepines, like Clonazepam. It is a difficult road for people who are trying to become clean. It is also a very difficult road for those who love the person and are trying to be supportive. During those times, it is important to remember to take care of yourself, too. As for taking your friend's pills, my concern would be the legal ramifications that you could face should you ever be caught with someone else's prescription medication, and especially these types of medications. Our laws have become much more strict surrounding prescription drug sales and possession due to the increase in prescription drug abuse. In addition, people who are in active addiction are likely to find some other means to get their drug, so it would do little to help the overall problem. I do not know about your friend's family situation, but they may be a better route to take if you are concerned about your friend. They may already be involved, but with your helpyoumaybe able to convince your friend to go to treatment willingly. That is usually better. In many states, there are also involuntary committal processes where a person's family may be able to convince a court to force the person into treatment. This varies from state to state. If your friend's family is not aware of this option, it may be something to look into. It usually does take a relative, or a medical provider, to begin this process if it is available. I hope this was helpful, and I wish you and your friend well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder.  How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Breaking up can be a very difficult thing. I am sorry you are feeling badly.  The first thing is to be really sure you are taking care of yourself --- that means eating well, exercising, getting good sleep, spending time with friends\/family and making sure you are taking care of important things like work, rent, bills etc.  Secondly, it is important to do things that make you feel better and not worse.  If looking up your ex on social media makes you feel worse stop doing it!  It is important to concentrate on you and not them.  Thirdly, it is super important to make sure you are really looking at the situation accurately and look for the good things that still exist in your life --- what is still good?  Even though your emotions are hurting and you are feelingbadly, can you see the light at the end of the tunnel? Do you feel hope? If you do try to concentrate on that hope feeling.

I would wonder about your experience with anger and if you have ever been discouraged from expressing anger.

It is sometimes hard to share our emotions and feelings with someone --- no matter how warm and caring the therapist is.   Are you comfortable with your therapist? Is it a good relational fit?

Is it supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cannot handle what I am happening and leaves me crying and worried every night? He changes his mind all the time. Although marriage votes say in health and disease, each person has the right to decide if he stays or leaves, depending on his ability to deal with the challenges of marriage. I understand that it is difficult to avoid focusing on him and his decisions, but the more you focus your attention on him, the more you will resent the lack of support. Focus on increasing personal care and developing your support system. A therapist can help you work with symptoms of depression, improve your self -esteem and develop defense mechanisms. You can also invite your husband to therapy to talk about your diagnosis and clarify doubts about the symptoms and expectations.

Does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs? If this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on, if perhaps it is occurring \"just during recess\" it could be something else altogether.

Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that he\/she may help mediate the conversation with them.If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents.

Can you understand where she is coming from?Sometimes when we are mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom, it is hard to know how to repair mom's relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite. Can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong; that the picture you may have painted of him is not the total picture? She might need help there.Thank your mom for her love and care, and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether you are together or not, that it is a risk you are going to take, and that you really need her support. :) END"}

{"prompt":"I was the one who ended it, and I am so glad I did. It was the best decision I made in my life. But how do I stop the nightmares and flashbacks? It is creating a wall in my current relationship.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" From what you describe about yourself, I agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decision.The nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic nature.The way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partner.Once you have stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship, then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually, maybe all at once.There is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored, abandoned, treated harshly during your time of growing up years.Since generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents, it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and were not aware of this until going through this terrible relationship.Congratulations on ending your relationship!

This behaviour, although it might get you the attention you want initially, will ultimately drive men away because it is not respectful of them. My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone. That is a powerful thought. You are certainly acting as if this is true. If you believed in your value as a person, you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general.If I were your therapist, I would have many questions for you and I would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from. I would suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour. Good luck! END"}

{"prompt":"I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it is an emotional nightmare I cannot get to the bottom of. I have had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship?\n\nWhile I am not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I do not take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and I have talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Helena,I felt a bit sad when I read this. This is a new term for me... \"semi-relationship\". What does it mean? I know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hook-up\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I am not sure you are female, but that is my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they cannot let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. Research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it is okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something is wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it is more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it is whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you would find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it is a feeling you are trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this does not work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence. END"}
{"prompt":"I am depressed. I have been for years. I hide it from everyone because I am scared of the reactions I will get.

It is exhausting pretending to be okay, and I do not know how much longer I can try. I am just really tired, and sadly, I cannot afford the help I need on my own.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Georgia, There is a really good lesson here. People tell us things, and we tend to think that is the truth...but it is not! I will do some translating for you...\"You are so ungrateful\" means \"I need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel I am a good parent\".\"You are too young to be depressed\" means \"I do not want to deal with your mental health issues right now. I will pretend it is not happening so I do not have to face my fear and shame\".\"It is only going to get worse\" just means \"I do not know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sake\".Your parents are being unsupportive, not because you are not suffering, but because this is all they are capable of right now. They are not where you will find the support you need, so keep looking for it in other places. It is out there. If might be an aunt or a friend, or a friend's aunt.

Are there any coping mechanisms I can use to break this cycle?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In dealing with an eating disorder you are far from alone. It is more common than you might think and tied to so many variables that it is easy for an individual to become overwhelmed in trying to navigate the influences of such variables. I have been working with individuals dealing with such challenges since 1998 and have found over the years that behavioral analysis is highly effective in helping you begin to isolate, understand and then be able to address many of these variable impacting your behavioral and cognitive choices. Consider finding someone trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy (DBT). There is a large body of evidence supporting the use of this approach to alleviating many of the aspects you identified in your post as well of a wide variety of tools that you can choose from and utilize that are able to practiced and assimilated into your daily tool box of coping mechanisms that end up becoming new behaviors and ways of thinking about issues that become automatic, the best possible outcome you can hope for if you want the solution to be sustainable.

{"prompt":"I cannot seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for posting. I am interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school\/employed\/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself. Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not alwaysfeel that specific emotion. There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize, we use words like \"always\" or \"never\" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you. Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I am overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I was not feeling anxious? What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? When was the last time I felt empathy? What was different when I was able to feel empathy? Hopefully this helps get you started.

If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it does not have to be.I do not know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations. END"}
{"prompt":"I cannot seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" . . . . . Is it normal not to feel empathy? It seems that I cannot experience any other emotion other than anxiety, even for myself. Empathy is the ability to use your own experiences to connect with others and be aware in the way they experience life. It is an interpersonal skill that we learn and refine with practice and as we mature as people. If you are feeling anxious, you may understand better as another person experiences moments of anxiety. But I wonder if instead of looking to feel empathy, you would really want to reduce your anxiety levels. A good way is to be aware that it activates anxiety, and since you identify it, explore that other reactions could have. END"}
{"prompt":"Sometimes I cannot stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I do not like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just cannot get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I do not think these thoughts are normal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic, and these types of questions, especially around heaven, hell, and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult & confusing feelings. What I want to focus on is the fear & anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions. Scary thoughts, negative thoughts, obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like they are out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them, but I want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic & anxiety.The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here is a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we do not pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I do not have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it is just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.I would also suggest when you are having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how you are breathing. Often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full, deep breath or what is called belly breathing. If you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths, bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale, just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins.

It takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems. Believe it or not, this problem is very common for men and women.There are some things that you can try naturally, before resulting in medication, such as your eating habits and exercise. I would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day. Do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly? How much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily? These are just a few common things to look at. You would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies. Our bodies are like a car. You have to maintenance it, in order for it to continue to run.If you would like to get further natural advice and\/or suggestions on eating healthy and exercising, I would recommend you see a nutritionist. A nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet. As far as your Doctor, I would recommend looking into getting another Doctor. I have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything. That appears to be a personal issue on their part. I hope I was helpful and I wish you the best of luck! END"}

You will feel that they not only understood what you were saying, but that they were also able to catch the \"in between the lines\" part and put into words what you have not been able to. The relationship with your therapist should be collaborative, there should be a fundamental element of safety and trust.

She then told my abuser the results of my tests.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission. There are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however. For example, when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client (or someone else) is in imminent danger, he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that person.If you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality, you can always contact your states' counseling regulatiory board. The boardwill then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action. END"}

The sleep should be addressed with a primary care\nphysician to rule out any physical issues. Sleep is the big reset and allows us\nto function in the day. What happens during a depression is that our thoughts\nrace and it is as though our brain will not shut off. Medication can help with\nthis.I also use a Pranayama yoga breathing technique called the four\nfold breath which has great usefulness for relaxing us and often does work quite well with allowing\nus to sleep.. You can read about it here: https:\/\/billleavitttherapy.com\/breathing-techniques-the-four-fold-breath\/Your\nthoughts on feeling worthless to everyone fall under a heading of thinking\nerror in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) known as overgeneralization. In CBT\nthoughts lead to emotions, so we are going to pick the statement apart and then\nreframe it. First list\nthe evidence that contradicts the thought. Has anyone in the past made positive\ncomments toward you? This might be hard to recall if we are in a rut, but at\nsome point in life we frequently have had some positives expressed towards us\nby others. Everyone is an absolute. The\nspecifics on why you are thinking this need to be addressed. How are you\narriving at this conclusion? There may be specific people that we want more\nvalidation from. Or specific people might have made offhand hurtful comments, (such\nas a family member, teacher or co-worker) but if I extrapolate that to a global\nand think that everyone thinks I am worthless, that thought is not rooted in\nfacts. \nWhat are\nthe Pros and Cons of thinking this way? What are the Benefits and Costs? There\nare very little pros or benefits to thinking this way. It is just going to\ncontinue to tear you down and make you feel bad. So can we reframe the thought\nabout the situation? Is there another way of looking at the situation? Again,\nwe need the specifics on how you are arriving at this conclusion, and a one on\none therapist can definitely help you with this, but the thinking that you are\nusing to arrive at the conclusion needs to be re-cast into a more helpful\nmindset.

{"prompt":"I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years, and it hits me harder every time it comes back. This past time, it was extremely debilitating, so I went on Wellbutrin. I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week. A month and a half later, I decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair. I became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what I needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment. I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay; a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away. However, I still do not feel my sense of self has been completely regained, and I have days where I feel a zombie-like haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything. Is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should I go back on the medicine?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated, as you have noticed, and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications. While there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication, as you have pointed out, there are often negative side effects as well. While I cannot give you advice on whether or not to continue medication, I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and long-term costs and benefits of psychiatric medication. If you can find a doctor, psychiatrist, or ARNP who is competent in mental health, it may also benefit you to consult with them.One thing that I am wondering about is, what is your support system like, in regards to your fight against depression? Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group? While there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression, psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring, competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference.

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist. Even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress, the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit. And the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not. It is best to have ongoing dialogue with the client to determine when termination is appropriate. END"}
{"prompt":"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.  Now he is depressed and hopeless again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This must be so difficult for both of you. Watching someone you love suffer so profoundly can bring up lots of difficult feelings. Without knowing what you are already doing, I have a few thoughts to share with you.First and foremost, know that you cannot fix this for him, and get support for yourself.As much as you are able, make space in your relationship for him to talk about what he is experiencing. He might not want to talk, and that is ok.If he wants to talk, try to listen without judgement and without trying to talk him out of his feelings. Focus on validating his feelings and just sitting with him in his pain.Let him know how you feel...that you love him, that you care, that you are concerned, that this is scary for you too, that you are here.I hope that this is helpful. On my website (www.sarahmcintyrelpc.com), I have written a series of blog posts about coping with distress. The techniques I have written about there may be supportive for you and your husband. Sending warm wishes your way.-Sarah END"}
{"prompt":"I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Remember, the past no longer exists and the future is just an illusion as we do not know what will happen tomorrow, so take the present as your guide.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. I have been really sad lately and for the past few months I have realized I am just way too dependent on him. It makes me really upset to be so dependent on someone else, but I cannot help it. I do not even know who I am without him.\n   How can I be less dependent on my him?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Recognizing that you are too dependent on your boyfriend can be a wakeup call and an excellent opportunity to work on your own personal growth and independence. It sounds like it is time to explore and develop your own interests and engage in some activities that excite and challenge you. If you have time, it could be useful to begin a new activity or class, cultivate friendships outside of your relationship with your boyfriend, and begin to reflect and meditate on ways to enhance your own personal fulfillment.

{"prompt":"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I am a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I am beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I have been happily married for almost 35 years.\n   I have never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Firstly, I would like to say how amazing that you have been able to live through breast cancer, sexual abuse as well as your depression and anxiety. You are stronger than you may believe at this moment for being able to continue to grow and live through these experiences. Take a moment to acknowledge your strength and know that this strength will be an asset during the therapeutic process that you will be able to tap into to find increased self esteem and more strength to address the concerns you are having. There are never too many concerns to address in therapy sessions. I hope you can find a great therapist who you can trust to listen and work with you to identify and address\nthe most concerning issues first. Once you begin to do this you may find an alleviation of symptoms and feelings which could allow you to grow your capacity to manage difficult feelings and situations and address additional concerns. Before you even realize it the issues you are having will begin to feel more manageable. END"}
{"prompt":"My husband always works. He does work from home, but his hours are from morning until night, and he neglects his family. If I have anything I want to do, I have to find a babysitter, but he does what he wants. He rarely comes to bed when I do, and we never have date nights.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Ohio, The crazy things about situations like this is that, almost guaranteed, while your husband is out working and away from home, he feels he is doing it all for you and the kids; he believes he is loving you. He might feel like he is carrying his family on his shoulders. Your 'love language' is different...you would rather spend time with him or talk to him...you want to feel like he is a bigger part of the family and feel connected to him. I absolutely understand that, and I support you asking for that.He might very well miss that feeling of connectedness too, but he is likely also feeling the weight of financial responsibility. A lot of men (and women) do not talk about this but they feel it. Sometimes they feel like they cannot win either way; there is pressure to earn and pressure to be home.He has needs too; he probably wants more appreciation and less blame.I urge you to talk to him about how you feel, find out how he is feeling, and use a professional to assist you if your communication styles are not great. Right now you WANT to spend time with him and that tells me that you have a good chance of addressing this problem successfully. END"}

I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I am fighting for. I am only in my early 20s.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting. A lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain. For other people, conflict is just hard to watch and\/or listen to.As for having a tough time trusting them, that could also relate to past events between you and these other people or it could relate to the conflict that you mentioned. It can be difficult to trust someone deeply when you do not know when the next big fight or argument is going to start.The next time you step in for someone, consider asking yourself what is making you do that? What are you feeling in the moment? END"}
{"prompt":"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.\n   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ideally you and your boyfriend will reach a balance point where you and your boyfriend are each happy with the level of involvement you have with your former boyfriend.Start w a discussion with your current boyfriend as to what specifically he does not like about your friendship with your former boyfriend.It is possible that you can answer his concerns as well he can find out from you more as to what the friendship is all about.As a therapist, I have never seen a former romantic relationship become only a friendship.  As sincere as you may be in your intention to only keep the friendship with the former relationship partner, if your former boyfriend secretly has romantic feelings for you, then at best, you have got an unclear friendship with this person.The obvious possibility is to socialize together with your current boyfriend and your former one. If neither guy would go for this, then this would show there is an undercurrent of competition for your romantic attention.Basically make your romantic partner's feelings and your own, the major considerations and discuss from this perspective.

{"prompt":"My mother-in-law is mentally ill. She has been for most of her life. She cuts herself. She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years. She has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself. She has had multiple shock therapy treatments, and she is on enough medication to take down an elephant. Her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late 30s. She does not even have custody of herself. She has not asked yet, but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child. How do I go about saying no without creating an issue?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Fontana,Thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question. It seems very clear to me that \"no\" would be the appropriate response. I like your healthy boundaries, and I will help you explore possible ways to respond to her.First, she has not asked yet, and you do not know that she will. Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. They are not hurting you and if you ignore them, they are more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if she is offended, that does not mean that you are being mean; it means that she has unrealistic expectations. So, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. You might never have to face that moment. But, I understand that you want to be prepared.As her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. Is he willing to do this? But if you are comfortable, and if you are the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it will not happen. And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying \"but maybe later\". No need to apologize or hum and haw...\"We love that you want to be around Junior, and we definitely want you in his\/her life. (try to leave out the \"but\" here). You are not in a healthy place, and we are not comfortable with you caring for him\/her on your own.\"If she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. I would let her know that it is not negotiable, that you understand if she is disappointed, but you are not open to discussing the issue. Really, there is nothing to discuss. Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life. I wish you the best. END"}
{"prompt":"I cannot understand what I pay attention to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate. You will more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of self-reminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work.

{"prompt":"My brother just broke up with his girlfriend. While they were dating for the past two years, her son spent the weekends with me and my mother. Now she does not think her son should have any interaction with us. How should we approach the situation? Is she doing the right thing for her child?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Tampa, I get that this is a loss for all of you; you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him. He is a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him. Certainly, it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son; if you are willing to maintain the relationship, it would be good for him to still have that contact. In my book, the more people loving a child, the better.But, ultimately, she has the right to make these decisions. To oppose her will not likely do any good. You can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it is hurting so much.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This can be difficult and confusing.If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling.If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. Then you can switch. Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with \"why\" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.

{"prompt":"I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he was not showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I am still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he was not sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and could not sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We did not have friends. It was me and him against the world. We did not talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me \"I am still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,\" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he was not just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he did not love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I was not attractive, I was not beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he would never love me again. I am still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I was not good enough and that I am no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but do not know if I should.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering. Losing the mostsignificant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death. There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside. With that being said, seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous supportmay be necessary for healing to take place. Anytimesadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately.A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are goingthrough, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task,it will only make things easier and give you asense of hope and purpose for your future. With the new year right around the corner, this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals relatedto living a more fullfilling life. Hang in there. Witha support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier.Best of luck to you! END"}
{"prompt":"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are probably no two therapists alike because first and foremost we are human beings!And...our personalities may somewhat guide how we go about getting to know you, identifying what you would like to be different in your life and developing a plan to get where you would like to be. The very most important thing that will determine a successful outcome is the healthy therapeutic relationship between you and your therapist. If you do not feel safe, comfortable and ready to work together, then it is likely not a good fit. And that is OK...speak up and the therapist should assist you in finding someone you can readily work with. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a teenager, and throughout my entire life, I have never really had good parents, or parents at all for that matter. I am not exaggerating. I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school. His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my moms house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time. Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs. My mom went to prison for that and lost her caf. We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were. My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison.\n   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that persons house. My parents did not get along at this point. We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out. He got out of the car, went to the drivers side, and punched my mom in the face. I got out and told him not to hit my mom. At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him. He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road. I could not even walk. My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her. I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance. He was so badly strung out on drugs. He went to prison again and seems to be doing well. I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he is so hard to handle. I think a lot of it is that I cannot bring myself to forgive him. My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dads mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she is more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents. I also stay at my boyfriends a lot. Now that my mom is out of prison, she is trying to control every aspect of my life. She is trying to make me move back home out of Susan's house, and I do not want to. I do not like it there. They condone drug abuse and many other things, and I am just not comfortable. She is even threatened to call the police and say I am a runaway because she has custody of me. My boyfriend has always had this picture-perfect life, and his family are strict Christians. One time, his mom even went as far as to say that if he and I break up, if we were having sex, I would say that he raped me. I have got so many problems I do not even know what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for reaching out and I can see that this is getting to the point that it is becoming overwhelming with all that is going on. To address your question, the best answer is that it will take time and from what I read you are still living through it , so your feelings are perfectly normal for the situation. I get the impression that you really need someone to process through all that you have been through and unfortunately getting adequate feedback would best be done meeting one on one with a therapist vs. through a question answer forum. If you are currently in school you could see about meeting with a school therapist or if you are over the age of 15, in most states you can consent to your own therapy. If you choose not to meet with a therapist I would encourage you to call a crisis hotline to help you safety plan to keep yourself safe around your parents 1-800-273-8255 If you chose to meet with a therapist keep in mind that a lot of what you experienced can be reported to Family protective services since you are a minor. You can also choose to make a report if you are feeling unsafe with your parents.I am glad to hear that you have your grandmother for support.

{"prompt":"My fianc does not think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There is a chicken and an egg, and I do not know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that?When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it is not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He is not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that.At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone does not send you a good message, right?See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you have been overreacting when he gets a text? So let him know you will not blow up about him getting a text if he does notconceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he is aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear.Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he will give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him. :) END"}

{"prompt":"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?\n How would I know how to \"train\" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The \"right\" therapist is a combination of expertise in the areas where you require, and fit as far as how comfortable you feel in speaking and sharing with that person. People generally are quite good at determining whether or not someone fits well with their personality and style; and another key to know whether therapy is working is to ask yourself: \"Do I see that changes have come about since working with this therapist?\" Do I feel better? Am I reaching goals that I set at the onset of therapy? Are difficult situations becoming easier by how I handle them? Training a therapist really is not necessary, as all it requires is open and honest communication in order to give effective feedback that will in turn be helpful to you and your goals. END"}
{"prompt":"It is been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I had not told him I knew because I did not want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still cannot get over this betrayal. I am not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I am grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we are not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that is it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriend's Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationship.Continue developing some points you have written here.That you grew up sensing and\/or witnessing your mom's emotional pain from your dad cheating on her, very likely set a standard in your inner self, to expect similar circumstances in your relationship life.This is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us. What we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as \"normal\", no matter how bad it actually is.After all, children do not have the ability to separate that what their own parents do, is wrong compared with the rest of our culture.It is natural to long for a relationship.What you have the chance to do now, is distinguish the reasons for your longing.Is it to attach to someone who has hurt you, has not shown you any understanding of having hurt you, and whose validation, even if he says validating words, has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm us?If you are able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us, and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you, then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime.

Is this normal?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Good for you to know your daughter's friendship circles and to notice when these have changed.While friendships are key relationships, they are not the only indicator of someone not developing normally.Is your observation and opinion that your daughter is not normal based on other factors or just this one?If this is the only factor then start with reflecting on what circumstances may be influencing your daughter to socialize with younger kids.Has she ben ostracized or bullied by her peers and may be retreating to avoid further emotional hurt?Is she keeping up with her school work?Sometimes kids who feel overwhelmed by schoolwork will regress into conditions in which they feel more success and control.Are there family circumstances such as the death of someone with whom your daughter felt close? Or, is there a new younger sibling in the family or a younger sibling who due to their own circumstance receives more attention than your daughter may wish for herself.Once you have reflected on which areas may be affecting your daughter, gently ask her some questions about her comfort with what you theorize may be the source of the problem.Its also possible that offering her your extra time and interest may increase her sense of self so that she feels secure enough to increase her social time with her age group.

{"prompt":"I am a survivor of domestic violence from a past relationship. Even after seven years, I still have horrible nightmares. I wake up in sweat, and the dreams feel so real.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. First things first, I am so glad that you are alive and very sorry that you had to endure such a terrible experience. Now, let us talk about these nightmares. The first thing I want to tell you is that you are NOT losing your mind. Many people start to think that may be the case if they are still suffering from the affects of something that happened a long time ago. That is not the case. There is no time set time for which we should be \"over\" something like this. I am not sure if you received counseling after what happened to you, but that may be something to consider. Bad nightmares could be the sign of something like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which would include other symptoms like being startled easily, re-experiencing the event, or avoiding places that remind you of it. There are other symptoms, as well, so if you believe this may be something you have you may want to seek counseling. There are good treatments for PTSD. If you cannot seek counselingat this time, there are some things you can do to try to manage the dreams on your own. I would encourage you to look up \"sleepy hygiene\" and try to make your bedtime rituals as relaxing as possible. You can also Google search \"Nightmare re-scripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" and get some ideas on how you may be able to change your dreams. It may be a good idea to attend a domestic violence support group and get ideas from other survivors who no doubt have had sleep problems related to their experiences, too. Hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}

We are not machines but rather humans who are going to quickly expire if we do not get a handle on our stress.As adults, it is time we intervene and teach our teens how to maintain a healthy balance between work and play. We need to help them prioritize andput first things, first. Are you putting first things, first in your life?If not, it is a good time to start.Best of luck to you and your daughter in whatever you decide to do. END"}

Does the Ministry really do something to help others? Experts define the counseling as a healing relationship that helps patients providing them with a space to ventilate, process and receive unconditional support. Some of my clients have expressed that they are able to find the answers to their problems during the Ministry session, because he has the person indicated by listening to them. Others say that they felt safe sharing their concerns with their family or friends, but those concerns affected their relationships negatively, or left them with feelings of guilt. So, why should people share private matters with counselor, (a stranger)? confidentiality is the key. A good counseling relationship must provide a space where people can share their most intimate thoughts and feelings, allowing them to be vulnerable and explore those emotions that are difficult to share without consequences. Beyond providing a safe space, the professional counselors are trained to identify symptoms, behavior patterns, and provide perspective in how to develop the necessary defense mechanisms to improve the quality of life..

Relationships do not tend to last when we treat people poorly. It is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating, with some strong effort. I would highly suggest working with a therapist, and I will give you a few things to think about in the interim.Sometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair, but many times, anger is a \"secondary emotion\", and it is simply there to protect us from other, more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid. Discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important. Perhaps you feel powerless, or unloved, or unimportant. It may take some time before you recognise this emotion.Once you do, you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion. Where did it originate? At what age did you feel \"too much\" of that feeling...so much so that you cannot stand it even in tiny amounts?You will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling. They are typically incorrect thoughts, like \"No one lifes me\", or \"People will always hurt me\". Fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that are not likely.Your habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of self-worth and you do not believe people will love you...so you hurt them to keep them at a distance. This happens in a subconscious level. Do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you did not believe in your worth? So, it is backwards really, because you think you are getting mad at people who \"piss you off\", but you are really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourself.In addition to this work, you can start to purposely treat people more kindly. Find out what respect is, make amends and resolve to spreading peace. It might sound too simple, but if you act as though you are a person of peace, you will start to feel more peaceful.But I hope you do contact a therapist. It will take time and support to reach your goal. END"}

Why did you and your ex break up 3 months ago? In relationships with others you get to see a reflection of yourself. Sometimes you may enjoy that reflection, other times it may not feel so good. I am not sure where you are in your life and relationships and what you do from here depends on what you desire more of in your life. But I am not simply talking in the moment desire, I am referring to the direction you want your life to go. If one of these guys was to support you...who would help you reach your dreams? And who would you enjoy spending time with? It is complicated and no one can answer the 'what to do' question but you. Slow down. Tune into your heart. Listen. END"}
{"prompt":"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yes, it is totally normal! Crying is a part of processing the tough stuff, no matter your age, gender or background and the therapeutic session is a safe space to do this. Sometimes crying can offer relief or provide room for deeper authenticity in session as you let both your strength and vulnerability shine in alignment. END"}

{"prompt":"Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together.\nIt all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed. That is when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again.\nThen she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that is what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.\nOnce I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for everything and said she did not mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she did not love me anymore and had no feelings for me.\nThe only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This was not an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I have treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I am losing my family and my mind. I do not know what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am sorry to hear of these troubles.  I see a few issues here.  I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled?  Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you.  People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on.  In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy.  It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship.  Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read.  One is Codependent No More.  The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable.  You cannot change her and cannot change her mind.  Sometimes the best thing is to let go.  If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again.  It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving.  I suggest backing off and letting her go.  Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind.  If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own. END"}

I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Anaheim,Relationships with therapists have some things in common with other relationships; they work best if there is dialogue about what your hopes, thoughts, emotions and needs are. Are you letting your therapist know what your goals are? It is okay to say \"I would really like us to focus on this piece\", or \"I am looking for specific direction about how to manage this part\". Your therapist is wise if they ask questions that determine what your needs are, but they cannot read your mind.Not every therapist will be a good fit for you. I know I am not a good fit for everyone I meet. We have different styles; some are more passive and focus on listening. This might be the type of therapist you have. For some people this is what they want, but maybe it is not for you. Maybe you want someone who digs at you more, asks more questions, gives you strategies, let us you know what they think... someone more active. If this is the case, it does not mean s\/he is a bad therapist...it is just not what you are looking for.Sometimes people think they cannot end sessions with their therapist; they might be worried about hurt feelings.

{"prompt":"Does counseling really do anything that can help people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" No, not really;And it is impossible for it to, anyway;And, this is is not some sort of \"you did it all yourself\" kind of blather;Because:1) In most outcomes, if a man or woman simply does nothing and waits, most of the time, they get better... (there are reasons to that);2) In most therapy sessions, approximately 92% (give or take, per study) of all outcomes--be they positive or negative--occur due to factors SOLELY WITHIN the man or woman seeking therapy to begin with;3) The word \"THERAPY\" does not imply cure, but implies treatment (suppression);4) Truly, a proper \"therapist\" will be able to spot the problem quickly, recommended proper protocols quickly, and coach to completion.5) Even if we PRESUME generosity, the \"therapist\" really does not matter much (maybe 8%); it really all is in you...Be well, man...

I do not know what is wrong with me and why I feel this way. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The thing I picked up immediately in what you are asking is how you do not like other people because \"they make me nervous and scared.\" If someone said that to me in a therapy session, I would want to understand this much more with them, and what this \"nervous and scared\" experience is all about: perhaps starting with the question, \"what is the earliest memory you have of feeling uncomfortable around people.\" The idea would be to try to understand all of what it means for you to be around people, and the history of the experience, without labeling it wrong or passing judgment on it.From there what might come is that certain people, and their character traits, might be harder to be around for you because of experiences that you have had with similar situations in your life. Or, it could certainly be something completely different. It would be most important to understand it much more deeply considering the amount of distress it causes you, and in doing so we could begin to see it as \"normal for me.\" END"}

What would you tell her? If I were her best friend I would tell her to run the other way.You may love this man. We do not choose who we love. But the evidence is pretty clear, is not it?A healthy relationship cannot be built on a foundation of lies and broken promises. I believe that as adults, we are always treated as well as we insist on being treated by our partners. If you continue to accept unacceptable behavior, you are likely to see lots more of it. END"}

Everyone on FB is happy, even when they are miserable they are happy telling everyone about it.First, yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living. Please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have, is not necessarily the true life they are having. I have been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30, start having problems by their mid-thirties.Second, respect your unique identity. For whatever reason, you have more sensitivity, possibly more depth, more complex standards and expectations, of yourself and others.As hard as it may sound or actually be, take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you, you need for your own growth and development.Feeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive. Consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goals.I hope this helps! END"}

In fact, counseling can help you understand how most of these things can be related to one another.

Once you begin to work through processing these life altering events that you have experienced, the hope is that you would see a decrease in your other symptoms. END"}
{"prompt":"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they are gone, I feel sad. It is been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief\/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes.

You may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma to work through the abuse if you have not already done so. Often times triggers still hold such a powerful effect when the emotions related to the abuse have not been fully processed. In the meantime, you may want to consider coming up with a Safe Word to let your partner know that you are being triggered or to communicate your physical boundaries to him. Often times, the experience of communicating your physical boundaries to your partner, having those boundaries respected and validated, and having a partner who is understanding and willing to engage in intimacy in such a way that does not violate your physical boundaries can reinforce a sense of safety with him.

The most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way.

You may notice that sometimes looks are deceiving women is bright and sunny outside, but is also quite cold when you open the door.

{"prompt":"Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" My son plays alone at recess.Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?Every mom is the expert on their childrens behavior. First of all, I suggest checking with your son, asking him if he is happy while playing alone, or does he complain that no one wants to play with him? Does he plays alone in school, but is social in other environments, with family or neighbors?Playing alone is healthy for children, it helps them to be independent and confident, it allows them to explore their environment and use their imagination, among other benefits. On the other hand, it is also important to develop social skills early on and become confident in our skills as we grow. Children go through stages of exploration until they develop a sense of social confidence. Depending on your sons age, he might need some input or advice. Provide the opportunity to interact with other children, without pushing it. Take him to the park to play with a friend or to childrens activities in your neighborhood. Later ask him, what did he thoughtof the activity, and if he enjoyed playing there. Children also follow their parents model, so you can encourage social interaction by greeting other and asking your son to do the same, ask him to receive the guests who come to the house with you and sit to enjoy the conversation.If you notice any shakiness, becoming tearful, anxious or aggressive when approaching social encounters, you may want to talk to the school counselor or childrens therapist to evaluate those symptoms and rule out any behavioral problems or social anxiety.Mi hijo juega solo en el receso.Debera preocuparme al respecto?

Observa si l juega solo en la escuela, pero es sociable en otros ambientes como con la familia o los vecinos.Jugar solo puede ser saludable para los nios, les ayudo a ser independientes, desarrollan sentido de seguridad, y les permite explorar su ambiente y utilizar su imaginacin, entre otros beneficios.Por otro lado, tambin es importante desarrollar destrezas sociales y perfeccionarlas con la prctica. Los nios van por etapas de exploracin y prueba hasta que desarrollan un nivel de confianza en sus destrezas sociales. Dependiendo de la edad de tu hijo, puede que el necesite algunos consejos.

{"prompt":"I am not sure if I am depressed. I do not know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step. If they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them. Inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting. this can help keep you on point.

{"prompt":"I have been struggling with it for a test and I am starting to believe it is something mental. What could it be?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello in Jacksonville,It sounds like you are struggling with motivation to either take or study for a test. There could be several different causes. If you were being seen at my practice, I would ask you to describe your self-talk when engaging in these activities, during the different phases ie. in beginning, after a few days, and after few weeks. Negative self-talk leads to increased disinterest and eventually tasks not being completed. It is great that you recognize that you have the tendency to not complete tasks that you start. Some questions that would be great to explore with a therapist are:how often you start and stop tasks without completing them?how you are feeling when you choose to start\/ stop a project\/task?how many tasks do you complete? Sometimes we need to recognize list our accomplishments so that they do not go unnoticed. Do you ever feel like you are working against yourself?A licensed counselor in Jacksonville will be able to asses you and rule out or diagnose self-sabotaging, depression, anxiety or other possible contributing factors. Remember to continue to provide yourself daily motivation and encouragement towards your goals. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a teenager. I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage. I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too. I get self-destructive. I used to cut but stopped. Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs. Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom. I do not live in a bad household. I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job. I have no idea what this is and I do not know how to control it. It is over any little thing. Tonight, it was because I could not get my earrings out. This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and it is always over stupid, petty things.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi. I am glad you wrote. In general, when a small thing bothers us (and this happens to all of us), it is because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt \"too much\" or \"too intensely\" in the past, and we do not know how to manage that emotion effectively...we just want to avoid it as quickly as possible. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively. You say that your behaviours are self destructive, and I agree. It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards self-harm, and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem. This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you. Again, a good therapist can help you learn what is behind your shame and self-harm. Your feelings are normal, and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help. END"}
{"prompt":"My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I do not want to hear it anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Then one day when life between you and mom feels calm, tell your mom that you are not able to listen to her complaints about your sister.The truth exists whether or not it is acknowledged.  Bu acknowledging what feels real and necessary in your life, you are helping your mom see what she may not like to see and what nevertheless is right in front of her.There is no good reason or good to come of hiding your own truth about not wishing to continue listening to your mom complain. END"}
{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" of I would love to know a little bit more about what is going on in your life but I will attempt an answer.Yes, you could still be shaky and nervous going to therapy. This therapy thing your doing is sometimes scary.First, because your opening up things that you might have never wanted to.Second, your still building a relationship with this therapist person. You may never get over that. The therapist really cannot be your \"friend\". They are there to push the buttons that you might not want pushed and help you heal. That in itself is scary and can make you anxious.Third, you really never know where this therapy thing will go. Yes, there are goals. But sometimes side roads need to be taken and sometimes that is scary.Know this you are in the right place. You are taking steps to change. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately. I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lately, I have been questioning everything from my career to my relationship. My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago. All of a sudden, I do not feel as comfortable around him as I used to, although I cannot seem to find a reason as to why I feel this way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around him?Has he told you that he is noticed changes in you?The good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person. Doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship. Given that the two of you recently moved in together, it is natural for new dynamics, feelings and expectations to arise. It just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of you.Psychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills. Very often, just being told the person has a \"condition\" makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually are.Anxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressed.It is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters. Be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you.  You are apparently self-aware since you are the one describing your own problematic situations. Keep the label of being \"disordered\", aside. Psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives. END"}
{"prompt":"I do not remember when the voices in my head started, but I remember Hearing them when I was little.    I know it is not normal to hear voices that are not your own. I fight the voices and I want them to stop. They have been here so long and I want them gone. How can I make the voices stop?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is not something you can do on your own.If you have not already, you need to see a medical doctor AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to rule out medical causes for this. Many diseases, illnesses, and conditions can cause hallucinations. In the elderly, sometimes it is something as simple as a urinary tract infection. Some medicines may have that side effect as well.However, you say you have been hearing them since you were little. I have no idea how old you are now, but something that has been going on for many years does lead me to think it could be a type of schizophrenia. A psychiatrist could diagnose that after taking a complete look at your history, medical history, etc. There are medications that they can put you on that will help.One thing that I find encouraging is that you recognize you are hearing voices. This means you are not so far into a delusion as to believe it is real. A lot of people that hear or see things that are not there are not able to have the awareness that these things are not real. They fully believe what they are hearing\/seeing. It is completely real to them. Because you have the awareness that you do, I feel this is a very good sign that with treatment you can live a normal life (assuming you are not already receiving treatment for it. If you are and are still hearing the voices, please know that medications often need to be changed and adjusted, and the voices may never completely go away but medicines certainly help dull them a lot. Always talk to your doctor when it seems your symptoms are getting worse so that they can make the necessary medication adjustments for you).If at any time the voices are telling you to do something, please go to an ER as this is an emergency. Sometimes people hear voices telling them to harm themselves, harm someone else, or do other things that are against the law. Do not try to deal with something like that on your own. There are people who can help. END"}
{"prompt":"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Affairs and infidelity are tough areas to address. The power of the affair comes from the feeling of injustice that seems to have happened to you. The struggle I notice people have is with the forgiveness. Forgiveness is something that is asked of you from your partner but also you have the power to give. I assume you want to forgive or have forgiven. However, the forgetting part is difficult.It seems that image of her happiness may have triggered something in you that is not happy. I am not sure how often you are triggered by her but it seems there is something there you need to process. The forgetting part sadly is difficult to put past your mind. However, it is being able to see the unfortunate situation they did and be able to walkthrough it even though it is painful. I think maybe speaking with a local therapist about this as it is often difficult to process alone. Also, see how you are feeling as days go on. Do you find yourself obsessed? If so, you may need to seek a professional counselor. END"}
{"prompt":"I just do not know what I want in life anymore. I am cannot figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. I cannot put things into perspective at all. I am just stuck, and I am disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly \"lose yourself\" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself. If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to \"take care of everything\" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly.Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you do not create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you. If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it is easy to re-create this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this \"self sacrifice at the expense of others\" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker\/enabler\/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self. Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you do not make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment. Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are. Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them. In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life. It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now. Take one small step at at a time. Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and\/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching. Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food! END"}
{"prompt":"I start counseling\/therapy in a few days (I am freaking out) but my main fear is that I will cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is is absolutely normal to cry in therapy. I can understand wanting to keep everything together and put your best foot forward with everyone you come into contact with, but it can be such a powerful experience to cry with somebody that can hear you and accept you. It is so brave of you to go and share yourself with your counselor! I hope you will keep being brave as you begin healing. END"}
{"prompt":"I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I would not make her daddy die.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is normal for a child to be so angry she wanted someone to die, but this seems to be heading into a dangerous realm. I think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious. END"}
{"prompt":"My fianc and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it is changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he is a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. We live two hours from family, and when I leave home to see family, he will text me saying \"whatever\" and \"leave me alone.\" But when we are together, everything is okay. No fighting or anything. I love this man, but I just do not know what to do anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Rockford, While no relationship is \"perfect\", and it is natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time, because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we do not have to smother each other with attention anymore, your situation sounds like something different.\"He has no time for me\"... yet you do not fight. Hmmm...Is it that you do not fight because you do not bring up what is bothering you? Are you avoiding conflict? Many people do. What do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away? As an engaged couple, now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance. Better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real. Or maybe you have spoken to him about it. If so, what happens? Does he listen and help you understand him better? Or does he avoid and reassure you...or maybe dismiss you? This is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together.He says \"leave me alone\". That is a pretty bold statement about what he wants. He does not seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is, and how close you want to be. Plus, I have to say, those words sound more like what a closed-off fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be!Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change. But if this is true, he needs to tell you that so you can understand.So, I suggest that the fact that when you are together you are \"okay\" is perhaps not the best barometer for how you are doing as a couple. Listen to your gut. I encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are. This may get rockier before it gets better, but until you face what is not working, you will not know who you truly are as a couple. When you are engaged, it is a really cool time to see a therapist too...to get some conflict resolution skills down before you are a married couple. END"}
{"prompt":"My toddler defies everything I say and does not see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. I would like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That is a good question. I would say learn to pick your battles. What types of behavior\/situations can you let go of? If you allow yourself to worry about the various areas in life that you cannot control, you will find yourself stressed out and unable to manage everything.Know that toddlerhood comes with lots of \"no's,\" tantrums, non-compliance, and a growing need forindependence. When your toddler does something that you do not approve of, remain calm, explain to him\/her the appropriate way to act, and model it for him\/her. Remember to give your toddler praise when he\/she does something good or acceptable. Be consistent and follow through with your instructions. Finally, know that you are not alone. Parenting comes with its set of challenges but all you can do is your very best. Good luck to you! END"}
{"prompt":"When having sex I think of other men and want other men all day long. Been married 3 years, together 14. What do you think?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff. It is a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage \"should\" be. It sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together, that is both common and confusing! Intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow. Resparking your passion will involve growing. Using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs (security) and wants (desires). Marriage is a people growing process; you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required. END"}
{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I recently broke up. One week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. He completely deleted me out of his life. He does have an opiate addiction. He claimed he was sober, but since we have split, I have heard many lies from him. Could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain, there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well. I would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns. Not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals. Being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when re-engaging in personal relationships. END"}
{"prompt":"My brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication. He is been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather.\n\nI was adopted in by his dad (who just passed) and his mother will not Get involved because she is afraid of financial responsibility. \n\nDo I have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, My heart goes out to you, your brother, and your family, dealing with a very painful and difficult situation.In New York, you cannot institutionalize someone else directly. You can, however, call the police or EMS. If they agree that he would benefit from hospitalization (and it sounds like they would), he can be held in the hospital for up to 72 hours, whether he agrees or not. Some hospitals will not hold a person that long, in spite of what we might want. I have seen many patients in and out of hospitals countless times, and it has been my experience that it can be extremely difficult to hold a person long enough to achieve good stability and an appropriate after-care plan. Hospitals in NYC tend to take a \"patch and release\" approach more often than I would like.It is been my experience that family makes a difference. Assertive, knowledgeable, persistent family can improve the quality of your loved one's care. Hospitals are highly pressured to discharge people quickly but they can not discharge a homeless person without someplace to go. If your family is willing to accept your brother, that will be the path of least resistance for the hospital. If the family refuses, they will be forced to find another path for him. You can also pressure the hospital to refer to rehab after psychiatrically stablized (which may only take a few days) and that may give your brother more time to begin making clear-headed decisions.If your brother has a psychiatrist, that person should be actively involved. I had a patient patched-and-released three times, in spite of my advocacy and him literally beggingto remain and stop his voices. We finally got a 90 day hospitalization because I strong-armed his psychiatrist into demanding that the hospital stabilize his patient. If your brother has a history of non--compliance with oral medications, you can push the hospital for injection, which again will help your brother stay stable for longer.Best wishes to you and your family.

If you google affordable or low cost therapy in your particular area you will find resources to help you. END"}
{"prompt":"There are intimate things she did early in the relationship, and things she had once agreed to try that she will not do now. I end up thinking about it all day. I feel rejected and think I married the wrong person.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would say you are letting fear get a hold on you! You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife has not initiated in a long while, but it is a big leap to go from that to \"I married the wrong person\". Fear is telling you that she does not respect or like or want you? Look at the bigger picture. What is the evidence that your wife wants to please you?...that she is the \"right\" woman for you?...that she loves you?...that she cares about what is important to you? If there is evidence there, then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughts.Talking to your wife is so important right now. We all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enough...but they cannot read our minds! Can you lovingly let her know what you miss? ...what you hope for?...what you need? This is the meat of a loving relationship. Sharing who we are, so that we can love each other better.Your wife deserves the benefit of the doubt that she will listen to what you long for. Can you risk feeling vulnerable? You cannot control her answer, but can you trust her to care? END"}
{"prompt":"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she did not have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your friend needs to admit they have a problem. If not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more. It is also a federal offense to take someone else's medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested. In other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them. Like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways. I would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation. Encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her. END"}
{"prompt":"Does counseling really do anything that can help people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yes, counseling can help people.How this happens is because the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoiding.Also, a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someone is strong emotions overwhelm them.This is different than in everyday circumstances. When someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone else's feelings, there is no one who asks reflective questions.Last, people get better in therapy because often therapy is the first time the person has a chance to trust someone with their confidential information and know this information will always be protected. END"}
{"prompt":"We have been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he does not love me. It is hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he is done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I do not want a broken family because we cannot communicate.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Communication involves a listener and a speaker. Both have to be willing to do their part to make communication work. This is something that takes both and not just one. Without both, communication is impossible. Staying together and the kids observing unhealthy communication is already broken. Seek help to improve communication.  Couples' counseling would be helpful. END"}
{"prompt":"My ex-wife married and used me to have a child. She now uses that child as a pawn. I know my child misses me, but I need to move on and not live in the past. How do I do this? Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am really glad you reached out. When parents get divorced, they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child. We might divorce our partners, however, we do not divorce our children. If anything our children need to know that we are still a stable force in their lives. Unfortunately, in some relationships children get used as a bargaining piece and I am hearing that may be happening in your relationship.You can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child. It is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child. It is important for your children to have some consistency in his or her time with you. For example, if you and your ex do not have a parenting schedule it is something that you want to create so that you can not only decide for you when you will see your child, but your child can know when you will be available just for her. This will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled times.I would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your child's life. How you can both be there to help raise her. If this is not a conversation that you can have on your own you might seek out help from the court. There are parenting experts and mediators who might be able to assist you.Remember, in any discussion keep the focus on what is best for your child and you will be moving in the right direction.Best of luck to you!

{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy. Therapy can be a rewarding process, however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies. I believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind & body connection. I would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that. It would be helpful to explore the feelings you are having with your therapist. It may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy. END"}
{"prompt":"My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We have had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She is on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy\/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result.\nTonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I have ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I do not know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You are newly married, you Have a hectic schedule, your wife is on anti anxiety medication. What if you take the focus (hint: pressure) off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another. You know, like the gestures you each likely made while dating. It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay.

But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Because the acrobatics and excitement of sex has nothing to do with the meaning of deeper emotional attachment to another person with whom we are in a relationship.Try to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband.

The current woman whom I am dating has been telling me for months to break up with her, but it is hard because I actually love her.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" My answer is yes, you should tell her because you have a child with her. She is the mother of your son, and this new baby would be his half sister. I think telling her is mature and appropriate. Usually procrastinating just makes it worse.Another thing to consider. Would you want her to tell you if she was pregnant with her boyfriends baby? Hope this helps, take care! END"}

It is not funny, just awkward.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I agree, it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all. And, if a person only jokes, then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer, this can also be quite tedious.Realize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression. You could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave. END"}

Do you have friends or family who are supportive?Can you find one part of you that you do not think is ugly?If your stretch marks are still bothering you, talk with a pharmacist or your primary care physician. Sometimes there are creams or lotions you can use to decrease stretch marks and they should be able to guide you in the right direction.You mentioned mostly physical things here.

{"prompt":"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he is not. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I am obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It is driving a wedge between us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Greenville, I respect that you are owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some do not, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cannot be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they do not reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like \"everyone cheats\", or \" you are not enough for him\". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there will not be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that does not support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You are learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That is the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting \"as if\" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It is possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck! END"}

So job one is finding someone you can talk to. A good friend or an open parent can be as helpful as a professional counselor, but if you do not have those, then by all means call your local Mental Health Association, suicide prevention, or go see your school counseling department. There are many of us now who do on-line, FaceTime, phone counseling so that is an option to consider in your situation. On the other hand, If you want to script a conversation with your parents (I am a great believer in scripting) not that you are going to read it to them, but if you write down exactly what you want to say, read it over a few times before you are ready to have the conversation. Why? You will be much more likely to do it if you are prepared, and you will have a better chance of saying everything you want to say in a calm but forceful way. The same with your friends--you are probably a great listener and therefore attract people who want to talk--so you need to let these friends know you need something in return. If you practice asking for equal talk time, then perhaps these friends will respond and surprise you, or if you make those demands you will start attracting people who are looking for equality in friendships. Now back to that script--first decide do you want to talk to both parents at once, or one at a time. Then begin to write down the points you want to make such as:  I love you, and I know you love me but I do not feel as though I can trust your love to be unconditional enough to tell you who I really am, and how I really feel. Find your own words to describe your own feelings. If I can help, get in touch.

I am not sure if I am inventing the symptoms and problems in my head or if something really is wrong. The feelings are very real, and it is very unlikely that you are inventing them, because the feelings are an answer both to the thoughts that are in our head, and, to the situations that occur to us day by day. Many times we think that feeling sad is bad, and that we should only feel happy, but all emotions have a purpose and reason, both joy, sadness, courage, frustration, excitement or despair, among others. It is not good to get stuck an emotion. So it is important to learn to identify that it causes our feelings, how to process them to overcome our emotions and move from one experience to another more peacefully.

{"prompt":"I have bipolar II disorder, I am addicted to alcohol and weed, and I am hopeless. I keep drinking even though it is harming myself and others.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Anyone who wants to change their life path, eventually will be successful in this. How to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps, most of them time consuming, with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional pain.The basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed. Almost always, addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored, humiliated, shamed, invisible, nothing very pleasant, since a very young age, usually starting around 18 months.Most often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their family.With no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing, the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outlet.So, people mask and numb by substances, whether this is food, chocolate, work, alcohol, weed.Therapy that is humanistic based, is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis oriented.If you would like getting serious about knowing who you are, including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years, you can do this.Once you have a stronger self-respect and awareness, you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people. Harming oneself is the opposite of self-respect.Also, about your diagnosis, it may not be true at all. the US healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugs.See if you can find a therapist who is independent minded, and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being, not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something \"wrong\".This simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first place.Good luck!

{"prompt":"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I do not know how. What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance I will use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said \"I am scared of snakes\", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C END"}

I do hear you minimizing your actions (you say you do not \"hit her enough to cause harm\"?), but you are headed in the right direction.I hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm you are causing is not just superficial bruising. The effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds. Please seek treatment for yourself immediately.You say you love your girlfriend? Do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues? Are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partner?You have dangerous habits because you do not know how to manage your own emotional pain. You can unlearn this; and it does not mean you are a bad person. Sometimes, however, the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended, for both of your sakes, because too much damage has been done.I know you do not want to lose her, but you do not own her, and you do not have the right to trap her in this because you are afraid of being alone. Right now, she needs some space to figure out what is best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants.This is potentially the first step to learning real respect; honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort.

She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. It is mostly my fault, I must admit. She does not like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I cannot fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I am always dreading when a better dude will come along. I do not think she is happy. She is very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay.

Most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you cannot change her, what you can do, is change yourself. We can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings. That is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher. I wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust. Has that ever showed up anywhere before? It has more to do with you and less to do with her.  Your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself. That is really where you want to focus. Once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know. You are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like.  Know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself. The rest will take care of itself. Finding a Therapist can be a big help in this process. You are asking the question, so I suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror. I believe in you and am wishing you all the best.Sandra Cooper, RIGHT NOW, LPCMH END"}

I am not suicidal, just tired.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Oak Harbor,My heart goes out to you. Sometimes when I am working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety, I ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds. \"What are the worst thoughts that run through your head?\". Often they struggle, perhaps out of shame; maybe they do not want me to know their worst thoughts. But I can help them better if I do know, because then we have a place to work from. You are feeling hopeless and worthless, and your thoughts support these intense emotions.I do not know you, but I strongly believe that you have someone in your life who, if they heard your thoughts, would say \"That is not true. I know where her value is.\" I believe that there are people who would see your value clearly, even if in small things. Can you imagine those voices?You mentioned God, so let us invite God into the conversation. What might God say to you? What evidence might God...who sees all..have of your worth? What hint might God give you about your purpose?You suffer from severe anxiety, and the agoraphobia works together with fear; they are a tag team. Fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you (or something equally bad), and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth. Do you see their plan? Make her scared... keep her here alone...convince her it is hopeless. They both try to convince you that they are your only friends, except they are lying to you. They only want power over you.You forget your worth. You forget that we all have worth. No one is a waste. I believe all God's creatures have worth, and that we are here to use our gifts to improve the world, and to remind each other of our value. There are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs. Can you find them? My guess is you have been alone and isolated for a very long time and it is impossible for you to see your worth in this situation. We need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors. We see our value in their eyes.Do you remember the first time you questioned your worth? What was happening that you blamed yourself for? Can you speak to that child and tell her (or him) that whatever's happening is not her fault? It is that child who cannot see her own worth, probably because someone treated her as though she had none. That is only a story though; not the truth. Can you find another thread of a story? Who might tell a story of your worth?Oak Harbor, I believe that there is help closer than you think. Fear wants you to believe it is hopeless. You reached out here...can you reach out again? Start with just one person, and that will lead you to somewhere. We do not know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone? You have stopped living. You can choose any moment to start.I wish you peace and hope. :) END"}
{"prompt":"How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Deciding to end a relationship is a big question that deserves your full care and attention. One of the first questions you may ask of yourself and consider for your boyfriend is whether you are both willing to work on the relationship. A relationship, no matter how great or hard, cannot work unless both people are invested in working on it. This means that both people are willing to take responsibility and work on their on stuff when things are hard rather than blaming the other. If one of you is not willing or able to work at this then the relationship cannot really grow or get better. Perhaps spend some time really asking yourself if you this is the person you want to work on things with. All relationships are hard and require care and attention and also ask us to really take responsibility for what we contribute. This should be done in a relationship where you want to do this work for yourself and the other. Also, if you are fully in and ready to do the work but your partner is not. If they say things like \"this is just how I am\" or \"we have problems because of your issues\" then you also may want to really slow down and consider if this will be workable. You and your boyfriend need to be invested and committed to the relationship even when things are hard. END"}

If you like what you hear by phone, the next step is to set up a face-to-face meeting. Studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor. Trust your instincts and if you do not feel comfortable, let him or her know that you do not think it is a good fit. Many counselors list on websites like Psychology Today and Good Therapy.

You said that you have never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend. Depending on how long you have been together and if you are looking at different ways of making a life together and getting to know each other on a deeper level, that is a different stage in a relationship and sometimes it feels different. Some people look at it as a difference between levels of passion and compassion, but there are many different terms to try to talk about it.Perhaps with this guy that you really love, you could talk about ways to keep things new and different in the relationship. Maybe you can leave notes for each other during the day or have a small surprise at random intervals (maybe an invitation to a picnic, for example).As for the other guy who makes your heart beat faster, what do you see in him?

People with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame.  If you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks, I recommend that you see a counselor to get a more in-depthevaluation.  The symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression, and with a bit of support, you could regain energy and improved self-esteem. The stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a labelof depression seem scary.

{"prompt":"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?\n How would I know how to \"train\" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One way is to bring one's concerns or desires to the therapist directly, rather than trying to subtly 'train' them. Here is why I say that:One quite important healing factor in a psychotherapy is discovering that problems in the therapy and the therapeutic relationship can be solved together.It is a safety zone or bridge for practicing that. If it can be done with a trained, usually safe person (the therapist), the client might think, wow--what are the implications for my outside life and relations? Could I get what I want outside of therapy, too, even if it feels not as safe?If the therapist can deal with feedback (and any good therapist should be able to), this can be very productive. Cooperation in this way, in the moment, with a live person who is supposed to have authority and knowledge in these matters, can be profoundly healing.If the therapist cannot take feedback or does not want to--or does nothing to act on it--maybe we could say the client has the wrong therapist.

This is a really hard problem for more teens (and adults) than let on. When I was about 15, I remember asking my parent's friend, Herman, whether life gets any easier when you get older. He said the problems are actually harder, but you gain the ability to deal with them better. I have been an adult a long time now, and that is so true.If you need someone to talk to, consider a teacher or a school guidance counselor or someone you respect, maybe in church. If they are good and they do not know how to help you, they may know how to get you to someone who can. Also, the idea of not being \"good enough\" is a common psychological event. In CBT it is called a \"core belief,\" but I call it a \"core lie\" in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.

If the voices are just at night, is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream?If you recall your nightmares, consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns.One thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room you are in. For example, take time to notice your feet on the floor, hips in the chair, and shoulders against the back of the chair. You can also try mindfulness techniques, such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns. These ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near you.Thanks for reaching out! END"}

It is likely that, if you are young, your body will change as you mature, but in general, we are given the bodies we are given and I am glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is. You seem to want to stop disguising it. Bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what her's looks like. Many men go through this as well, although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how we are supposed to look.Young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them. In fact, other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatever's going on with you.I suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear, and if someone is rude enough to comment on it, you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and they will get the hint.

Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :) Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent. Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone. I like to think of therapy as an unbiased \"aerial view\" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps! END"}

How do I stop feeling this way?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your question is very broad because feeling empty can develop for many different reasons.You are certainly not alone in feeling this way!Try to follow the logic of your feelings by asking yourself questions about the empty feeling.  Doing this may open up a discovery about the reason for the emptiness feeling.When do you feel empty, are there certain situations it happens more often than another, what helps the feeling go away, what or who is helpful in relieving the empty feeling.Sometimes people need a little help to get started in understanding how to recognize their feelings.Consider a therapist, any disciplined practice which encourages self-knowledge, such as some yoga practices, and a creative discipline like photography or music.As long as you concentrate on increasing your self-understanding, eventually you will find the answer to your question!

{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you have only been to a couple of sessions, it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first. Therapy is hard work! You may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before. Opening up to stranger can be scary. After you feel comfortable with your counselor, and trust has built up and you feel understood in session, you should feel more relaxed. I would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky. Sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work. If you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions, it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from. For example, are you and the therapist not a good fit? But, again if you are just starting out in working together, feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense, and I encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling.

But here is the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It is the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff.

It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things.I do not know whether you are also saying that you feel sad or if you are saying that you feel as though you do not have any big changes in your feelings.A lot of us tend to be really busy, and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we do not have time to have positive time for ourselves. Sometimes even if we are spending time with friends, we are thinking about work and all of the other things we need to do.I wonder if it feels awkward when you are with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to. Maybe if that is more comfortable for you, it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those moments.It sounds as if you may have had an experience (or more than one) where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward.

In other words, family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all, you cannot make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him.Research codependency. There is a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Do not loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Do not call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his drivers license. This may mean that he loses his family if he does not stop.What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they do not then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you do not live with your dad, then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in.You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to, but are for the family members. They can help you. END"}

My first thought is, these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places. Since they are adults, and you cannot force them to seek treatment, you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider. .

But since it is such a new disorder I cannot find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite. Since you are giving a lot of empathy, maybe you would like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you have felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly. Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you would like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you would like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of studies and lists and formulas. Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines do not necessarily mean very much. Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent.Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.

Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life. Children have a way of making things their fault, even when they have done nothing wrong. Because of this, when parents cut off contact, the child thinks it is their fault.As hard as that already is for a child, it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life. This makes the belief even more strong for them. They start to think, \"why does dad keep leaving? What am I doing to keep making him go away?\"I believe a child needs both parents in their life. Whether she used you for a child or not, that child still exists and never asked for this. They did not ask to be born into drama and two parents that cannot make things work.You can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child. If you start over far away, this may mean less visits but you will still be a part of their life. Just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it.

It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what because depression. Somethings you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively.Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead tofeeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally,keep ajournal to write down how you are feeling and what ideasyou have to helpfeel better.

During these first months the roles in marriage are defined, they also face new challenges together that they resolve become rules and agreements. Yes, you can solve these problems by practicing assertive communication. They should clarify what the problem is, as they feel about it and how they want to solve. Learn to solve discussions with clear decisions and remembering that if they care about each other, and that is why they decided to be together in the first place.

{"prompt":"Does counseling really do anything that can help people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation. For some, this process can take a very long, winding path of self-discovery, while, for others, they are seeking a purposeful, solution-based way to approach and manage a specific problem. It is important to remember that there are different styles of therapy, some of which will work great with some, but poorly with others, specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. I often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice, in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals.On a more specific note, there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours. However, medication is not an effective way of treating the problem, as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety, lowered mood, etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication.

It is very difficult not to have negative feelings to friends who do not strive to take care of our relationship. The interpersonal relationships (positive negatives) need two or more people who give and receive: and communication. But what they have of special friendships is that they last over time, at least with those we call our true friends, those who know us well and with whom we have a special connection, and from whom we sometimes disconnect, without fear of losing them. Consider that it is happening with you and in your friendship, talk with your friend about your concern, let him know that you would like to spend more time together. Plan some activity that interests both or discover some new interest. If your friend's response is not positive or enthusiastic, give him time and approach other people who share interests in common, or dedicate yourself to doing things you enjoy in solitude. After a term, communicate again to know how this, and leave her friend (a) is there.

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling. A major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client. This may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time. If the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy, it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy. The process of termination must not injure the client and, if necessary, the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities. Another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care. If the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else, he or she may need a higher level of care. In this circumstance, the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit. A third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship. For example, if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship. In this instance, the clinician should refer the client to another therapist. Finally, if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment, the clinician and client should terminate treatment. END"}

My heart is burning, and I cannot take this pain.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi, San Diego.I am sad that this was your first experience (in 25 years) with feeling in love. You deserve better. My understanding of today's (western?) social cultural norms is that it is somehow acceptable to abruptly stop communicating with someone you have been seeing, without explanation. I do not get it. It is rude. You are better off without this person around. There are still people who operate with respect, but this person is not one of them.If I am reading this right, you knew this person for a week? In my humble opinion, much heartache and many poorrelationships come from attaching too soon. It takes years to get to know someone deeply. I know it is hard to keep yourself from falling in love, but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly, because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happens.If I was your therapist, I would be curious about how this is the first time you have fallen in love? Or is it that you were in love 25 years ago? Was your heart broken then, or did something encourage your heart to close? What has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now? Is there a danger that you will decide love is not worth the risk? This is a crucial time for you to potentially seek professional support from a therapist in order to understand yourself and not shut down, if that is what happened before. :) END"}

Communicating this way can feel awkward at times, but it could reconnect how you are listening and deeply connecting with your partner. Also, you may discover that you are on two different pages about things on which you thought you understood what each other felt, wanted, or desired.Consider what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special. Can you name a few things and get them right according to your partner when you check in? Can he do the same for you?You could also try doing two things every day that would be appreciated by your partner without either of you having to ask for it.

{"prompt":"I have felt this way for two years. I feel so much better now then I did when it started, but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of de-personalization is quite normal for everyone, it will come and go throughout life, kind of like being on a roller-coaster, \"here it is, then it is gone not to return for quite some time\", like many things, the more that you fixate on it, the more stress it will cause you, consider it part of life, accept it, and move on, now if your having many, many ,many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at, but for the most part nothing to worry about.

{"prompt":"I am on my own with my daughter. I am so worried and stressed about her.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your instinct to help your daughter, is natural.How you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem, or if only you see this from observing her.Also, her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describe.If you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems, and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life, then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit her.If your daughter is in your legal control, then you can locate a counselor nearby, discuss your situation with that person, and depending on the outcome, you would be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselor.Starting therapy without willingness to do so, is risky. The person may feel resentful enough to not participate.  And, sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter, or any patient's self-interest and engage them in therapy.Family counseling, regardless of your daughter's age, is another way to bring your concerns to your daughter's attention, in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughter's psychological problem, from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter, in how to handle certain situations.Also, if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself, then instead of this slower route, get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town, for a more immediate response.

{"prompt":"I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I would not make her daddy die.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately. It is also very likely that your daughter does not understand the permanence of death. Having said that, she is using some very specific ideas here and I would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with children.I would also wonder where she is getting this idea. Sometimes children hear things on TV or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are remembering.It may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry, like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking for.I am curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry. Does she say the same sorts of things about you?It may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional (possibly the same one who is working with your daughter) so that you can have some support with this as well.

{"prompt":"He is not violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He is working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sometimes relationships just do not work. Do not feel that the first, second, or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life. The one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up. It is good you all went to counseling, but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior. It takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal. I would suggest doing you...meaning focusing on your own growth at the time. If he wants to grow with you, he will make the necessary steps. If he does not...wish him well. END"}
{"prompt":"It is especially bad at night time. I am scared of sleeping alone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it, is the first step to addressing and handling it!Generally, anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life.Somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt insecure when very young.Usually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonable.Their inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young, has not faced the reality that the grown person is now capable, even if this takes some practice.Try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown person.Also, sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely. This loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now, felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address.

{"prompt":"My husbands ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husbands ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters. The step-father has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently. The ex-wife minimizes it by saying that he has \"repented.\" It is a constant strain on my husband, knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography. My own therapist believes the girls should be told.

{"prompt":"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As you do it more, it should get better or at less with less anxiety. Anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public. I hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years. I even experienced that when I first became a counselor and had to lead classes. I asked myself why were I so anxious? I admit at that time I did not have confidence in myself. The more I prepared and practiced, the more my confidence level increased. Yours will too...  END"}
{"prompt":"My ex-wife married and used me to have a child. She now uses that child as a pawn. I know my child misses me, but I need to move on and not live in the past. How do I do this? Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You can \"move on and not live in the past\" in the context of your ex-relationship, but that does not mean moving on from your child. \"Moving on\" then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your ex-partner as far as is possible for the sake of your child's development.Generally, it is good for a functional (non-abusive) parent to spend time with his\/her child, but only insofar as that does not because your child unnecessary stress. That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their child.What is confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him\/her (depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn). When dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child. If you cannot come to an agreement, a counselor can help mediate a conversation. If that is not an option, then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules (for which you would have to consult with an attorney). END"}
{"prompt":"I have bipolar II disorder, I am addicted to alcohol and weed, and I am hopeless. I keep drinking even though it is harming myself and others.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change. Frequently our problems keep us in denial. Although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling, it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone. The best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together. Alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider; preferably someone who specializes in addiction. Know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is, it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed.I really recommend an inpatient stay for at least 30 days for anyone who is dealing with addiction, whether combined with mental health issues or not. If this is not a possibility, then the next best thing would be an Intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues. Know that there is hope for what you are experiencing. You can get control over these issues. The next step is finding the team and\/or facility that is going to help you do it. END"}
{"prompt":"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes do not know what is real or not. If feel at times like everyone is lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thanks for posting. This is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless; among other emotions due to the uncertainty. You said that, at times, you feel like everyone is lying. Ask yourself some of these questions. What is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying? Where is the concrete evidence that they are lying? How could I test my thoughts about this? What if things are not what they seem on the surface? Am I any lesser of a person as a result of this person's behavior or opinion? Our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave. It is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions. You can start this process by answering some of the above questions. We are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with. As it pertains to if God is a lie; be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that God is or is not real. It may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that. Hope this helps at least a little bit. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been dealing with this for years. My mom thinks I am overly emotional and refuses to offer any help, like therapy or seeing a doctor.

I just want to get better.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I do not know how old you are, but in Pennsylvania, if you are over 14, you can have therapy without your parents' consent. If you are young enough to use their insurance, that could be complicated, but depending on the state, there may be ways to work around that as well. If transportation is a problem, call a local mental health agency and see if they can connect you with assistance.In the meantime, try searching for a phone helpline in the county where you live. They may be able to help you figure out where you can get help.Another idea is that if you are in school, your guidance counselor may be able to provide links to where you can go for help. He or she may also be able to give you more specific ideas to help with your panic attacks.I know you said your mom refuses to offer help, which included seeing a doctor, but I wonder if she trusts the doctors that is your primary care physician (also called a family doctor) who you see when you have a minor medical ailment that may need medication. That doctor may be able to help you as well.Some of the information here may be helpful to you because it explains some of what anxiety is and there are some quizzes there that may give you information to discuss with a doctor or therapist when you get connected with one.http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/anxiety-panic\/guide\/mental-health-anxiety-disorders This may give you other information to speak with your mom about. Remember that I am not asking you to actually diagnose yourself with one of these things, but just offering some basic information that may help you be able to talk about what is going on.If you are having a panic attack or having a moment of anxiety, try focusing on different things in the room around you. It may help to shift your focus briefly outside of what you are feeling and that may lessen the feeling a bit. Also remember that sometimes anxiety leads to more anxiety about having a panic attack in the future. Remember that they usually and after a few minutes.It would also be helpful for you to keep track of what leads up to your anxiety.Best wishes to you and keep trying until you get connected to someone.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend. He goes to see her twice a week or more. Every time she leaves, he gets into these funks like when his mom died. When she is here, she is disrespectful, and his answer is Well, I do not know what to tell you. She swears and talks back, and he laughs. He and her mom have been apart for three years, and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young. We never have adult time when she is not here. She is the \"golden child,\" and he will not listen to anyone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Lockport, Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky. You do not tell us whether you live together or not. If you do, your position is perhaps more difficult, because his daughter's behaviours affect you; you live in the home.A bottom line for me is you do not tell someone else how to parent. That is for your boyfriend to decide. When he is there, he is the parent, and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined (or not). Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree, or you think you see something that he is not seeing, it is simply not for you to interfere there.It sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support. He has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned. Do you talk about these things? Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to do?Although I suggest you leave the parenting to him, what you can do is tell him what you see, offer suggestions if he is open to it, and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you. It makes sense to say \"I see you struggling and I do not know how to help\", \"I have noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her. Are you aware that it is coming across this way? Do you need help?\", or \"I feel sad and frustrated when we do not spend any time alone together.\"You sound a bit resentful of his daughter. Is it possible that your real struggle is about whether you are ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his child?You have a voice, and it is great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel. Ultimately, however, you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is, and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it. :) END"}
{"prompt":"I am in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I do not know how to tell them because I am afraid they will not want me anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunatelyI cannot do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only \"right\" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both ofthese things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone is emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support thatyou need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a \"Coming Out\" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that theirfeelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You do not have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}
{"prompt":"I was with my boyfriend for years on and off. We dated and broke up three times. Since we broke up five months ago I cannot move on. I want to get back together but he will not talk to me. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for you.When a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly. A break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life, not only that the person is no longer connected with us.Since your boyfriend is not talking to you then you are keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions. There is nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking, this person is the only one who is in charge to start talking.Maybe since you have had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before you are willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanent.Be patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship. Once enough time passes so that you are considerably past the point at which you and he come together, then accepting his leave-taking will feel natural.Right now its very understandable to have hope since you have been on this road before. In time you will have your answer as to whether your future is with him or not. END"}
{"prompt":"I am concerned about my boyfriend. I suffer from anxiety, but I always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in BDSM intercourse. We have not tried it, but I have had this feeling he always wants to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \nHello! Thank you for your question. There are few things\nthat people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel\nconnected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if\nwe feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. \nI do not know the specifics about your relationship or how\ncomfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those\nsituations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to\nthat would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you\nbelieve that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like\nthere is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case\nthen remaining safe is your top priority. \nAssuming you are able to share with him your feelings,\ntelling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate\nand sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for\nall parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say no to\nabsolutely anything they are not comfortable with. \nI call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, sex\ntrust. Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they\nwill not degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or\ncoercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. Your personal safety and mental well-being is\nwhat is most important. \nNow, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM\nand may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you\ncan explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles\nare better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. \nMany people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but\nagain, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is\nalso important to know that BDSM is notjust one thing and people practice it\ndifferently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,\nthen you should not feel obligated to do it.\n\nI hope this was helpful. Be well.\n\nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\n END"}
{"prompt":"I know I need to deal with my depression. But I do not know how and I do not want to tell anyone.    How can I deal with depression without telling anyone?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It can be really tough to tell someone - anyone - that you are feeling depressed. But finding that supportive person that you can share with is a big part of the battle with depression. Depression thrives on being secret, it seems to grow the more we isolate ourselves and hide it away so I am with Laura Cassidy, when she suggests finding that professional support person so you can start fighting back against your depression. If that feels like too big a step right now, maybe check out a book or two... I am a big fan of a book called 'Feeling Good' by Dr. David Burns if you want some practical thoughts on tackling depression and on 'Radical Acceptance' by Tara Brach if you prefer something a little more spiritual.

{"prompt":"I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but do not know how to tell my dad.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. This is certainly a tough spot. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things. You may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues, or if you have ever heard him talk about it. That may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you. For example, if he has been watching the news lately, transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot. Has he had an opinion? This will not tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender, but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people. To tell you the truth, the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you. There is no right or wrong way, best or worst. If you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him? That is perfect. Want to have a friend with you for support? Equally perfect. Whatever thing you need to do. And, of course, there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so. Unfortunately, the response from your dad cannot be predicted. Some parents are totally cool.... others not so much. This is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea. If things get heated, you have someone in your corner. There are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy, and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him. You can also Google some stories about how others came out.I refer many people to the www.letsqueerthingsup.com blog. It is a popular blog written by a trans man that I know. He writes on many topics related to trans issues. Hope some of these suggestions help. Be well... be you.. and good luck!Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}
{"prompt":"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since it is clear that people react differently to the samestressors, we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety, our thoughts about the stressors are. Often, cognitive distortions are the problem. Some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it is not perfect, it is terrible), mind-reading (I just know he is angry at me) and cannot-standitis (I cannot stand this situation). There are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, I would advise looking up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local CBT therapist. Another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called \"symptom stress\" - being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, \"Oh no I am getting nervous about this, I am getting uptight, I look nervous, what if I have a panic attack!\" followed bymore cognitive distortions such as \"I cannot stand being anxious!\" and \"this is horrible!\"Theantidote to this is acceptance. Kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (Jon Kabat-Zinn). If you happen to feel anxious, say to yourself - this is just a reaction I am having that is unpleasant, but not horrible. I can tolerate and survive some anxiety, I can breathe deeply,and I will be OK because panic attacks never killed anyone. I can stand this and it is temporary. You get the idea.We can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. We have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. We brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to self-perception theory, \" we learn what webelieve when we hear ourselves speak,\" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :) END"}
{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the best case scenario, it is a mutual discussion and decision. If not, I have had the discussion initiated both ways, by me, when I sense the client has gone has far as they want, by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments, missing or cancelling appointments, usually at the last minute, lack of participation during sessions. Client initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments,, by forgetting their calendar, or their checkbook :) , by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals (once a week to once a month, for example). I rarely have had to terminate a working relationship--that is why I do not charge for the first visit, so we know if we are a good fit before we start working together. Then I periodically ask whether the client feels we are making progress, moving in the right direction, talking about the most relevant issues etc. END"}
{"prompt":"What should I do when we see each other?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am so sorry this happened. Sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful.

I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage. If your husband was to work with me I would explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others.Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I would challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and\/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories.

It is also good that you are able to identify that it is not always a physical need that is driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you are consciously trying to quit, you will find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I am on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I will give in and eat it.You are going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That is normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That is what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (\"Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.\"), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I have suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they are going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby! END"}
{"prompt":"How can I get to a place where I can be content from day to day?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One thing that comes to mind is making a list of some things that happen each day. It could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are, but because so many other things are going on, you may not notice.Another idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day. This way, when you are having a rough day, you have a list to think of and take a look at.Are you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you (typically at least two meals per day and roughly 8 hours of sleep that night (may be different depending on your age)? These two ideas are closely related to changes in your mood.From where do you have support? Friends or family?Can you take 5 or 10 minutes per day to do something that you enjoy?If you think back to the last time that you felt \"content,\" what was contributing to that?Another possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day. For example, rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break, consider actually tasting it and enjoying it. Also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well. For example, when you finish your paperwork, take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your e-mail, reading five pages of a book, or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task.

{"prompt":"I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years. At first, we used to do things together and our sex life was ok. Then things started to change, we would break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times.  We have also had two beautiful baby girls during this time. Now we argue and he says I am not affectionate at all or I do not know how to please a man, when I work part-time, take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook. Sometimes he cooks, but he also spends a lot of time on the internet. In addition, I have 2 boys and he has 1 son. I feel somewhere I have lost something. It is not that I do not care, I truly love this guy, but I am just tired of being the one who is always being judged. Please, I am in need of a Christian counselor to help us because I really need to speak to someone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I do not think you have lost something, I think you have found something - your breaking point, and it is about time. Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when it is convenient for him. Obviously, he has his own issues, but I want to address yours. I agree you need to talk to someone. The fact that you have put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it (by saying you are not affectionate enough, etc.), tells me you probably have low self-esteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you do not deserve any better. You do! You may truly love this guy, but based on his behaviors, he does not love you, not in the way you deserve. And although you may want to believe he can change, he has proved over and over again that he is not willing to, so you need to do what is best for you and your children. What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way? Would you want your sons to treat women this way? That is what you are teaching your children when they see this.Like I said, I agree that you should talk to someone. You can ask your boyfriend to go too, but my guess is he will not. Even if he does, you should still see someone individually to work on YOU. I understand it is not easy to just kick him out, especially since you have children together, but a counselor can help you talk through all the details whilehelping you raise your self-esteem and self-worth.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant.  I do not know what to do to fix the relationship.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been, or more importantly you have felt that he is. This will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyone is perception can be different. Remember that relationships take work and take communication. END"}
{"prompt":"I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent. Although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation, it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child. This situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child. END"}
{"prompt":"I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation.A lot of times, these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. You internalize it and accept it as your reality.The first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. Even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood. Children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems. The obvious, such as being abused, can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem, but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person.You may have never been physically or sexually abused, but what about emotionally? Were you yelled at, berated, put down? Were you told you would never amount to anything? Were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short, could not live up to expectations? When you hear something over and over again, you start to believe it.Maybe you were not yelled at. Maybe it was the opposite. Studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect. A chronically depressed mother, for example, may have seemed cold, detached, emotionless. She may have been less likely to show interest in a child's life, not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances.If one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up, chances are, a lot of the attention went to them, which could have led to your needs not being met.Any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant, unheard, unloved, or like they do not matter.Maybe nothing I have described here fits your situation. If you cannot pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own, a counselor can help.I am not saying \"blame it on your parents\" or telling you there is nothing you can do to change it! Quite the opposite! Understanding WHY you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition - figure out the WHY. Then behavior - the HOW. END"}
{"prompt":"I think I am annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I am just fine. I do not think so, I think I am stressing everyone else out\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \"Where you put your attention is where you will go\". I forget who said this first, but it is very powerful. If all you think about and talk about is how annoying you think you might be, that will get annoying. Your intense self reflection is lovely; it will help you monitor yourself so that you are not affecting others negatively, but your alarm is going off too easily here and you risk having the opposite effect.You do not have to be perfect. She is with you, so she probably likes you as you are. She seems to put far less emphasis on your possibly annoying traits. We all have faults and if that is what we focus on, that is all we will see. My hunch is that your most annoying trait might be your negative self-talk. How ironic is that?There is another irony here...your goal is to be a better partner...but when you are self-critical, your focus is on you, not her. Every moment that fear grabs ahold of you is a moment that you are not being present in the actual relationship; you are gazing at your imagined faults. Fear steals your ability to focus on your loving partner.Maybe take a moment to image how she sees you...all of you. Put yourself in her shoes to see the entire you...how are you loving...thoughtful...a good partner? Confidence is a very attractive quality! END"}

She does not like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I cannot fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I am always dreading when a better dude will come along. I do not think she is happy. She is very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole \"If you love them, let them go,\" but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I cannot break up with her. I am literally trapped.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Are you possibly mixing up an impulse to nurture and protect someone, such as by offering housing, and your own need to feel loved and appreciated as a romantic partner?Maybe your feeling of jealousy is really your awareness of a reasonable need to be loved by a partner.Even though you are quite detailed in your description of your partner, one piece which is missing, is whether you feel you are loved by her.Maybe too, what she considers your insecurity, is really her unwillgness to love you.It is always easier to put distance between two people by insulting them.I hope this gives you a few new ways to look at your situation.A few therapy sessions, either by yourself or together w your gf, would give you more chance to know more deeply what it is you are facing.

{"prompt":"My daughter is in later elementary school. She cannot color in the lines. Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Developmentally, there are ages where not coloring in the lines, writing words that are jumbled together, and leaving big spaces or skipping lines are completely normal. I have seen children in 3rd and insome cases, 4th grade who do not have learning disabilities write in the manner you have described.There is, however, a type of learning disability called Dysgraphia which can present in the ways you have described. If you suspect that your daughter might have Dysgraphia, then the best thing to do is to have educational testing done. You can request testing by going through your school system and asking for an IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) meeting. Your school is required to honor your request for an IEP meeting.At the meeting, you can ask the school to do educational testing that will be at no cost to you. I will say that depending on where you live and your school system, it can sometimes be difficult to get the school system to do testing. If that is the case, you can go to a psychologist or find an agency near you that can also perform this type of testing as well (some will accept insurance and others will not.) There are also educational advocates that you can hire to help you if you ever have difficulty getting your daughter properly assessed by the school system. I also highly recommend seeing a developmental ophthalmologistand\/or a developmental pediatrician. They can be great resourcesin helping you to determine if your daughter does have a learning disability.I always say that a parent should \"trust their gut\" and if you feel that your child is struggling and that there may be a learning disability then there is no harm in getting your child evaluated. The best case scenariois that your child is completely on track and what you are seeing is developmentally appropriate. On the other hand, if your child does have a learning disability, then you have caught it early enough where she can receive services that will help her in the long run. Either way, it is a win, win.

If you try to speak to mom or dad by themselves, it may create that intimate atmosphere needed to understand where you are coming from.2) Friends: Like parents it can be difficult to speak to your friends about challenges with your mental health.

I am scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and do not have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you are going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC END"}

I would encourage him to continue to do so, no matter the extent of his thoughts - his trust of you being able the handle his experience is of utmost importance. His containment and sense of security is also dependent on your reaction to what he shares.

{"prompt":"I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes.

But it sounds like it is not all the time, which means we can easily say that this \"hate myself\" experience is one part of you. There are many other parts, if you give them some space to also \"speak up,\" that will offer you more positive regard, trust me on that. Generally speaking, we just do not know how to listen to those parts, because......it is the \"I hate myself\" part that is our inner critic. And often, our inner critic has developed a lot of strength throughout our life because of how we have depended on it for certain things. Sounds crazy, but in actuality, some of the most \"successful\" people, in work mainly, are those that have strong inner critics. They use these critics to motivate themselves, but with people, and in relationships, and in our relationship with ourselves, it completely backfires, because relationships are far more dynamic processes than \"doing well at work.\"So, try to acknowledge that the inner critic is one part of you, that you have learned to give a lot of space to. But, if you sit with even a remotely positive feeling you have, it can also be given the space to speak up and grow, just like the critic has over time. END"}
{"prompt":"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I do not have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am so sorry about your loss. Losing someone you love is always difficult, however, losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life. What makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister. It is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided, but what I suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you. It is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way. By her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were \"never close\" to her is her opinion. Only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother. If there is truth to this, then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor.  There could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence, but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will. You and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle. When two people are grieving the same loss at the same time, it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle, even if they both were on good terms with each other. Depression is part of the cycle of grief. It is absolutely normal to feel sad, as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms (i.e., feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, low energy, sleep or appetite changes, etc.). Anger is another phase of the grief cycle. Your sister may be stuck in the anger phase, not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness, so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you, in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grief.Finally, it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated. Were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss? Depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder. Depression can be situational (i.e., triggered by an event) or related to genetics, undiagnosed health issues, stress, trauma or other potential risk factors. If you have a family history of depression, you are more susceptible to have depression. It would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider, and if necessary, get treatment through counseling and medical interventions. END"}
{"prompt":"I am transgender, I know I am, but I have only told a few friends. I know I cannot tell my family because of previous conversations we have had. They just would not accept it.\nMy gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is a difficult situation to be in, as it sounds like you are feeling very isolated from both your family and your friends. I do not know your age or gender so please excuse any incorrect assumptions about you being under 18 and use what is useful from the ideas if you are older. One idea is to research online to find a therapist or a local clinic that has a therapist who is a \"Gender Therapist\" or a \"Gender Specialist.\" Most therapists who are transgender affirmative also have other specialties and do general therapy. Though I do not think lying to your parents is a good idea, if you feel you truly cannot talk to them about your gender, then perhaps you can find a therapist with a specialization in gender identity who can help you cope with your gender dysphoria. You can let your parents know that you would like to see that particular therapist for other reasons, such as anxiety\/worry, and that you researched them and liked their website. Work to find a therapist who takes your parents insurance if you can. You can also talk to the therapist on the phone first, before you talk to your parents about scheduling the first therapy visit. Therapists can help you learn some ways to manage feelings of worry, shame, and fear related to gender dysphoria. Depending on your family situation, many therapists will work to help you learn skills to safely communicate with your parents about what is troubling you. Your parents may actually surprise you and be more accepting than you think. Usually when parents learn that you are suffering, they want to be open to learning how they can help you, even if awkwardly at first.Reframing is a tool that helps you think about your situation from other perspectives. It is kind of how you can look at the same picture with a different picture frame and it makes the same picture look a little different.  Keep in mind your situation is probably temporary and think about in the context of your whole long life (can you tolerate another 2 to 4 years living like you are if you have another X number of years to live?). If you are living at home, you will eventually be more independent and be able to make more of your decisions about your gender expression. Keep the idea in mind the concept that is popular in mindfulness classes I teach, that \"This too shall pass\" or \"This is only for now\" when you start to feel hopeless. If you start to over focus on your gender or body issues, try to distract yourself with things that make you feel happy (your pet, music, art, sports etc) or stay busy. If you can, find any GSA or LGBTIQQ youth group that you can attend confidentially, further away from home, to get some support. Work to find an ally, one person, that you can talk to about what you are feeling. Making new friends online through social media can sometimes be a start in breaking down the isolation you feel. Another idea, if you are under 24 years old, there is a phone line (866-488-7386) to call in case you are ever feeling you are in crisis. You can also text chat! Trevor Project: http:\/\/www.thetrevorproject.org\/There is also a trans teen online chat group if you are 12-19 http:\/\/www.glbthotline.org\/transteens.htmlIf you are an adult you can get numbers to call in your state if you start to feel suicidal:http:\/\/www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org\/Day to day, can you creatively work on your gender dysphoria? Yes! Are there ways you can focus on parts of your body you love? Can you focus on that when you look in the mirror? Are you a writer? Can you write stories or poetry about the life you imagine for yourself in the future? Can you do small things that help you get more in touch with your gender day to day like making small choices about your clothing, like wearing clothes that are more unisex, that only you know are gender related but others will not notice? You cannot force others to accept you but you can work on your self-acceptance and self-compassion. That work is something that is best done in the company of others like you as well as with at least another person who gets you and whom you can trust. Good luck to you!  END"}
{"prompt":"Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it does not usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they do not have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt does not necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive. When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it does not happen again.Thatyouhave done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it does notusuallyhelp the people who you hurt. In fact, someone is guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor. Be well,Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}
{"prompt":"I constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff. It is constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious. I do not sleep because I am thinking about something I can get rid of. I do not know why I do it. I started years ago when I lived with my dad then I stopped when I moved in with my mom. Years later, it has started again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived, would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parent?Play in your mind with the metaphor of \"throwing away\" and whatever associations you feel toward this. Are you feeling alarmed or freed, by throwing away things? I am only suggesting these, not telling you that they apply necessarily.Anxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives. So pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years.  Possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years' relationship with either parent.Basically, sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are, once all the clutter is released.

{"prompt":"Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather. How can I fight this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One theory is that instead of \"fighting\" your feelings, accept your sad feelings and work with them.  Feeling sad may open many doors to reflect and make peace with the source of your sadness.Also, I believe fighting against the natural cycle of rest and hibernation may not even be possible to succeed.  Winter for most creatures is a time of withdrawal and slowdown. Our bodies and moods are part of nature as well. Fighting what is part of nature seems like a tiring fight which the person will lose.Last point, there are the winter holidays to break up the dark and cold of winter.  Maybe you can invent some of your own winter celebrations so you will have a few gatherings to look forward to hosting. END"}

Maybe you intuitively realize that they do not want to understand or know about this.How did you come to the conclusion that you have PTSD?If you are working with a therapist, and a minor, then the laws of your State dictate what information your parents can ask your therapist about you.If you are a grown person and working with a therapist, you have complete legally protected privacy of what you talk about with your therapist.In any case, a good starting point is to know exactly your own reason for wishing to keep your psychological situation hidden from your parents.

{"prompt":"My mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though I am in my 20s. She argues with me over stupid stuff.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is a common issue. You grow up gradually, and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance. I am all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom.Ultimately, you only have control over yourself, so that is the place to start. You can remind yourself that Mom's behaviours do not mean that she does not trust you or love you; it is just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range. If you can see her responses as habits, rather than a reflection of how she feels about you, then you can keep yourself calm. The more calm you are, the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship.Take a look at the picture from her perspective. She may feel overwhelmed with finances (are you in college?), and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she does not know how to recruit help for. I bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you, cleaning, cooking, doing laundry...all those thankless mom tasks. Take a look at how she talks to you... is she nagging about chores? Can you see that underneath the nagging there is a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance? Okay, so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef. She wants help. You want respect. Let us talk about how you get both.I propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic. \"Mom...I see us as stuck in how we interacted when I was fourteen. Can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want?\" Sell it as \"win-win\". Then you write down some things that end up forming a contract.The first part is stuff that is your business and your business alone: things you want your mom to respect, like your room, your school, your job, your personal relationships and hygiene.... Mom's voice has no place in these arenas, unless you are storing food in your room and it is a health hazard. This is a \"Mom says nothing about\" list.The second part is about what Mom needs from you. What are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult. Does she want you to contribute to rent? Buy your own food? Do your own laundry? What items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of Mom? How will these things be enforced? What will happen if you do not follow through? Write it all down so it is really clear. It has to all be mutually agreed upon.The third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you, and how you talk to her. You can let her know that you do not want to be told what to do or when to do it; that does not work when you are 20 years old. Listen to what she wants too. Beyond the contract you have just written up, anything else you want from each other is a request, it is optional, and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. My guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect, you would be more willing to help out. AND, I think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. Go for the win-win.I wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with Mom. :) END"}

{"prompt":"I have been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It has not been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I am abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I am afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Do you think you are abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is because you already are addicted.Drugs do not do anything helpful in solving life's problems.  Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?  The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you. END"}

I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I do not want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique. We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities. Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items. END"}
{"prompt":"After I told them, they yelled at me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like your family responded out of fear! They may need some time to digest the information. This can be hard for a family to hear for several reasons but you should be proud that you had the courage to tell them. Once they realize how brave you were and how much you need their support they will come around.  Maybe you can write them a letter (for them to read without you present). In the letter, you can tell them your struggles and maybe why you decided to tell them. A letter will give them a little more time to digest the information. END"}
{"prompt":"My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" People often have very different values and opinions when they are drinking excessively and when they stop drinking so much.Did the two of you share drinking as an activity? If yes, then did you stop drinking too?Often when partners meet each other as drinking buddies when one gets sober, the relationship ends. Once the terms of any relationship changes, one possibility is that it dissolves.The best way to go is to start the conversation of what you genuinely want. This is the only way she will really know your thoughts.Ask her to give serious consideration and discussion over at least a few weeks or months, to moving away from you. This is a fair request since you are in a relationship.If she is changed so much by giving up drinking, which is possible, that she no longer wants to be in relationship to you, then you are better off being without a drinking gf, even if the truth she delivers is a hurtful one.

I know my attitude is also a big issue for him. I have a lot of obligations at home so we do not spend a lot of time together.    How can I fix this relationship?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A key factor in a relationship is trust.I would start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bf.Does this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships, or with a sibling or parent?Its also possible you are intuitively sensing you cannot trust your bf because he is not trustworthy. Sometimes people sense the basic safety items in a relationship before they emerge.Also, your bf may have similarly suffered broken trust and he gives off a feeling of not welcoming your trust.Its possible you are feeling his own self-protection about being in a relationship with you.The best way to open these topics is to actually talk about them together with him.Whatever the underlying tensions are, talking about them always adds positive feeling and confidence to a relationship.

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The termination of a relationship can be a challenge to heal from. Having obsessions after a breakup are very normal and many of my clients experience them. It can help to create a distraction box and when the obsessions present themselves use your distraction activities. In the beginning try to distract from the obsessions for 5 minutes and work to increase that time over time. Celebrate your successes when you are able to distract yourself. END"}

Why do I feel so alone?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many possible issues to consider as depression social anxieties, even medical illness. For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up. Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating. Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support. Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive. Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences. END"}

I realize there a few ways to look at this. I presume you were notanticipating feeling this way; and probably hoped to feel the opposite.. Well, my initial response is yes, sure, it can be within reason to feel this way. Have you been in therapy before? Is this somewhat new? That could be part of the reason. But either way; new or not, I think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul, it can cause anyone to tremble. The soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here, and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change. Looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary; so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen. OR, is there something about the therapist you do not feel confident about? This too might be in play as a reason for your feelings... Maybe you lack confidence in that therapist ? Have you let your therapist know how you feel? That would be good to explore...I would like to encourage you to look at these ideas. Hope it helps. Let me knowKindly,keithkeithcounseling.com END"}

Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Not at all my dear.Human beings are complex creatures, and in my opinion, our issues interconnect in a very nuanced web between our levels of being (for example, mind, body, and spirit). Everything you bring up affects all three. The truly beautiful thing about the human body is that when you begin to work on one, the others improve as well!I would encourage you to seek out a counselor who is style and approach speaks to you and start with whichever issue feels most pressing to you. A skilled therapist will flow with you at your own pace and make recommendations to other professionals (e.g., physicians, holistic practitioners, EMDR specialists for trauma etc) as needed to complement the psychotherapy work you are doing with him or her to help you find the total healing you seek.I wish you well on your journey!

We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or did not receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you do not matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!

END"}
{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It depends on your definition of \"normal\"!:) I would say that the average client I see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions, and especially at the beginning. I think that with clients who I work with that have difficult times in relationships, maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences, the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessions.In my opinion, a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from (talking about yourself, relating to another, something else?) I encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment, as it is helpful to the client to recognize the \"present moment\" emotion and then being able to process, learn from, and move through to a more peaceful place, if that is what is being sought.

I feel he is an evil man with no feelings.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Louisiana, You got it right...he is \"supposed to be\" your father. It is tough enough being adopted (unless I am reading it wrong, I think you are adopted); what you do not need is to be verbally abused by someone who is supposed to love and protect you. I do not know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It is your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That is a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who is going to be in your life. It is tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it is possible...physical distance (avoid him if you do not trust you will be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you are already doing that part because you do not blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I do not know if he is evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest.A good therapist can support you in these goals.

Is it something you can talk to your parents about?A school counselor could help you. The counselor could possibly order an evaluation to determine how to help.Build your self confidence - Start slow with your family and identify a subject you are familiar with and add to a general conversation.

I do not know if I am ready to come out to them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularly\ndifficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are supposed\nto be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so\noften that there is actually a term for it \nbi-erasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that\nbisexuality is a real thing, or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs\nlike your parents seem to have. \nThe unfortunate truth is that you can never\nbe sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds\npromising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it may\nsimply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate\ninformation, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. \nSome of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some morethings that you can consider\nand questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them:\n\n1. If they do not respond the way you want them to, have you developed a support\nsystem to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all\nthe friends in the world will not prevent pain or sadness if your parents do not\nrespond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE\nokay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember. \n\n2. There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can\noffer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for\nthem to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young\npeople because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from\nGLAAD about bi-erasure: http:\/\/www.glaad.org\/bisexual\/bierasure\n\n3. Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take\nplace when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media,\nand even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are\nready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, do not\nfeel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out\non your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand\nthis. \n\n4. Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just\nbecause someone is LGBTQ does not mean that they necessarily want to be. Many\npeople struggle with this. Having\nyour own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are\nin telling your parents. So, perhaps do some self-exploration about your\nfeelings toward yourself. \n\nSometimes people take friends with them\nwhen they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want\nto consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If\nyour parents do not respond well, that does not mean that they never will. Some\nstart off upset, but then work their way through it. \nBest of luck to you. \nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}

Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" At times when a child is not displaying milestone behavior at the same rate that is average for their peers, this should raise concern, so you are correct in reaching out for advice. Speaking with your child's pediatrician, as well as school staff may be the first places to start. You can request that she receive an assessment and evaluation, with a subsequent treatment plan to meet any needs she may have. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a teenager, and while I have never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. I cannot go into stores (grocery stores specifically) on my own, and when I do, I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. I also forget things a lot.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" With the way you described your anxiety, it sounds like you have different types of anxiety. I am not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone (sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It is also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. For example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself \"I am anxious right now and I am okay\" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own (which is very common), consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.Also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable. END"}
{"prompt":"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Something to remember about anxiety is that it is a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action.Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I would recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as \"my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies.\" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful.If you feel that these techniques do not help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I would highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy\/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms. END"}
{"prompt":"I have hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young.  I sometimes still do it but I do not exactly know why, \n\nI have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I will start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I do not know how to stop or even why I am doing it. \n\nHow can I help myself to change my behavior?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Give yourself a lot of empathy and care for having had a rough childhood and realizing that life can be better than how you were treated when growing up.Be patient with yourself too because lasting change takes time.Alternatives to hitting your head require constant gentle reminders to do these new behaviors, or if you have discovered a satisfying alternative in one moment, time is required for you to repeat this alternative until it feels natural.Anxiety usually means someone did not feel well understood growing up and was rushed to comply with the wishes of others who were a regular part of their lives.Anxiety lessens as the person starts to know and accept their wishes and needs as valid. Allow yourself to learn who you truly are in the spirit of accepting whatever you discover about yourself.The behaviors will naturally change with your new understanding and self acceptance.Good luck and enjoy this self discovery project!

Is this normal?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is certainly an important issue tolook into, It is always helpful to speak with the child's pediatrician since they are most familiar with the child'sdevelopmental history. Also, children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over, this can be as simple as a loss of a pet, a recent move, death in the family, and\/or as serious as sexual abuse, and other things.

{"prompt":"My mother and I have an okay relationship. I know she loves me unconditionally, and I love her the same. However, more times than not, I am afraid to tell her anything personal because she either does not listen, she turns it around and makes everything about her, or she ignores things - even when they are about my mental health.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How can I get my mother to listen to me without her freaking out?Communication with our loved ones can be tricky, but it is the key to maintaining a healthy and functional relationship with them. At times, it seems difficult to communicate with our family because many feelings and undercover messages are attached. Especially with our mothers, who often provide advice and feel responsible for us, it may feel like they are making everything about themselves as they express their worries and concerns.So what to do? First will be important to practice active listening skills, to ensure that you are receiving and understanding the message, without filtering it trough your own emotions or preconceptions of the person who speaks. Second, learn and practice assertive communication skills. Those will help you to communicate a message clearly and in pieces. It also emphasizes using I-statements to express how you feel at times when emotions become affected by the interaction. Third, you should practice, by writing your I-statement or role playing with your counselor. The trick with communication skills is that we need to practice them as often as possibleuntil you to master them. You can also contact a family therapist to improve those skills if it becomes challenging, or contact a mediator if more issues arise.Cmo puedo lograr que mi mam me escuche sin alarmarse tanto?La comunicacin con nuestros seres queridos puede ser dificultosa, pero es la clave para mantener relaciones saludables y funcionales con ellos. A veces, nos parece aun ms difcil comunicarnos con nuestra familia, porque hay muchos sentimientos y mensajes envueltos en la comunicacin. Especialmente nuestras madres, pueden hacer parecer que estn convirtiendo el asunto en algo personal, cuando se sienten preocupadas y responsables por nosotros y nuestras acciones.Y qu hacemos? Primero debemos aprender a escuchar activamente, para asegurarnos de que comprendemos el mensaje, y que no lo estemos filtrando a travs de nuestras emociones e ideas de la otra persona. Segundo, aprende y practica comunicacin asertiva. Esto te ayudara a comunicar un mensaje claramente y en pedazos. Tambin te ayudar a aprender expresiones del Yo, para identificar sentimientos afectados durante la interaccin. Tercero, es importante que practiques estas destrezas, ya sea escribiendo o con tu consejero. El secreto est en practicar las tcnicas de comunicacin cuantas veces sea posible, hasta que las uses espontneamente. Si tienes dificultad aprendiendo estas tcnicas, o el conflicto con tu mama es uno muy difcil de resolver, puedes contactar un consejero o mediador familiar para que te asista. END"}

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision. Here are a few examples.The counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with. A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue. If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer. Beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues. This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues.Another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit. No counselor is the right person to work with everyone. If the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things do not seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work. A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session.The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on. While this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end. However, counselors know that this is part of the process. They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end. This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into.All of these (and other) situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending, to monitoring how things are going, then engaging in self reflection, possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor follows through.

The thoughts are awful.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change. Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on, developing ways to cope, and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences.

{"prompt":"I am planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it is hard. Sometimes it is not a physical need, it is mental.\n   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" While smoking can be incredibly difficult to quit doing, it is not impossible, so the first thing to NOT lose is hope. And certainly planning to have a baby can be exactly the catalyst that one needs to motivate to complete this sort of task. But, as I said, it still will not be easy, even with the motivation there.There is a definite physical component, but it is great that you can acknowledge the psychological addiction that exists. It would be helpful to dive into what that psychological need actually is, as it can vary from person to person (whereas the physical addiction does not as much, and therefor can be helped through gums and patches and inhalers, etc.) Exploring and getting to the root of the psychological need can help you to determine what is going on for you psychologically, and how else you can meet those needs of yours, perhaps in much healthier and more adaptive ways, that also help you to feel really good about yourself. While replacement is not always advocated, having psychological needs is not something to be ashamed of, but rather nurtured. END"}
{"prompt":"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Change is about giving a new meaning to past experience, to allow for the emotions we stored in our body to be freed.

She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I do not want to or cannot answer. I tell her I do not want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You are doing the right move to state you do not want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression. If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept. You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this. END"}
{"prompt":"I am in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I am not as attracted to him as I should be.

However, I also do not want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the \"perfect guy\"? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The basic guideline for relationship satisfaction, is to know what you can and cannot live with and without. And, since you are considering marriage, for how long do you imagine yourself being satisfied living with and without certain qualities of your partner.There is a hard wired dynamic between two people that defines the basic structure of the relationship.While life is filled with surprises and can change in an instant, the basic way in which the partners of a couple, connect.Do you understand why you are not attracted to your partner? Whatever the reason, now is a good time to state this about yourself. He may be quite willing and interested in developing new ways of sexually stimulating you. Maybe he is just as shy about talking about this topic as you are. On some level he must know that he does not satisfy you. He may be relieved to hear you bring up the topic!As always, remember that if discussing a relationship matter feel hard to start, consider utilizing therapy services with a professional, credentialed and licensed therapist.

He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I cannot continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming.

It is sometimes hard to share our emotions and feelings with someone --- no matter how warm and caring the therapist is.   Are you comfortable with your therapist? Is it a good relational fit?

{"prompt":"That phrase makes me crazy. It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change, such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie. Another example is when he opens the front door, the dog runs out if he does not pick him up. Over and over again, he let us the dog run out, and I am afraid he will get hit by a car.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I empathize with your feeling \"crazy\" hearing your husband yell \"enough\" in response to you wanting to make a point to him.When the immediate situation has calmed down, have you ever told him that this upsets you? Is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to you?Keep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change, may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to change.A helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down, is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happened.By learning more about how the other person thinks and feels, it will be easier to know what to expect form each other.Even if you disagree about what is best, knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept, or at least not be surprised and startled by them.Sending good luck to both of you!

{"prompt":"Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It is like I cannot get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now we have become friends, but there is this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we are physically in the same place.\n   Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I am now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we are a really good match. We have never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He is been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I did not want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I am sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They are supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.    I do not know what to do. I need some closure or I am not going to be able to move on from this. I do not know what it is, but it is driving me crazy. I am so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He is such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I cannot get it out of my head. I am trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I cannot sleep because my mind is racing. I have never been so hung up on something for this long ever.\n   I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I do not know if that is a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I cannot move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I do not want to.\n   Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you are in a relationship and you are having strong thoughts about someone else, it is important to pay attention to that. Although you say you are happy, I would suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you are getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you do not have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just do not feel excited about him for some reason. That is a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You cannot have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass is not greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future. END"}

He is lucky to have you on his side (although he may not always see it that way).As far as whether you can sign him in, that depends on a lot of different things.I would suggest that you Google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to \"crisis hotline.\" They can tell you how it works in that county. My guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment, but I cannot be entirely sure.You could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility. I have not heard of that being a problem, but I guess it would depend on insurance.If you have trouble finding a local hotline, consider calling the national crisis number (800-273-8255) and ask them to help you find someone local.

How can I make the voices stop?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First, let me express my support and compassion for what you are going through. Hearing voices can be incredibly difficult and can feel like you cannot get a moment's peace, even in the privacy of your own mind. And not everyone will necessarily understand what you are dealing with, so I imagine you may also be feeling isolated or somehow different. Atta girl\/boy on reaching out for help!Many people find benefit to taking medications, such as risperdal, seroquel, and so on. These should be prescribed by a nurse practitioner or psychiatrist -- I do not recommend a primary care doctor venture into this area, as a general rule. Discuss the options thoroughly and insist on a good rapport with your prescriber, if you decide to go this route.Some people are having results with a talk-therapist to develop coping strategies. There is a new and somewhat less conventional approach to challenging voices with a professional to assist you, rather than to suppress the voices, which medication will do. There is peer-run organization and a general approach that attempts to live with voices in a different way. You can read about it in Living With Voices by Marius Romme. I have heard interviews but have not read the book(s) and cannot speak to its efficacy.No matter what steps you decide to try, managing your stress, sleep, exercise, healthy food is essential -- in other words, just the daily care and feeding of yourself should be included in all of your efforts and bears surprising benefits to your brain and emotional health.Best wishes to you,Karen Keys, LMHC, CASAC END"}

But since it is such a new disorder I cannot find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite. Since you are giving a lot of empathy, maybe you would like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you have felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly. Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you would like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you would like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of studies and lists and formulas. Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines do not necessarily mean very much. Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent.Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.

{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yes, feeling nervous for the first few or several sessions of therapy, is completely normal.Therapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone.  The person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions.  For some people the fear is that the therapist knows more about you than you do yourself.In general terms hopefully your therapist has worked with many other people who have faced problems similar to yours.In this sense the therapist has a general idea of the basic dynamics you most likely are handling.No therapist could possibly know your particular details and your particular areas of upset or in what ways you feel unsure of yourself.Once you start to trust both your own right to tell your particular story and start to also feel that your therapist is listening attentively and cares what you tell the person, your nervousness will start to disappear all on its own.Good luck in getting the most from your therapy sessions!

I would be curious about what it was like at the beginning for you both, but these things can change. Sometimes people with sexual barriers are very active for a period when they are young because they are trying to prove something or overcome a fear.Right now, you can both accept that there is a barrier and it is hers and she can explore that in a safe relationship with a therapist and perhaps a doctor. It is possible she is asexual (not interested in sexual activity but very interested in love), or that a trauma has affected her. It is for her to explore.

We do not have sex anymore, which bothers me tremendously. I have become close friends with a coworker, which I know is not helping. Nothing will happen with that, but there is the thought.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" . . . . . . . . Remember that to Marriage is like a see good friendship with benefits, but subjects the responsibility kills The Fun. How can I fall in love with my wife? My wife works late almost every day, I love her with all my heart, but I do not feel intimacy as before. We no longer have sex, which bothers me tremendously. I have approached a friendship of work, which does not help. Nothing will happen, but there are thoughts about it. First the first! Friendships that develop in times of crisis can be great emotional support, but they can also become something nebulous when there is sexual attraction. entertain thoughts about it will only make a bigger challenge. Be careful with that friendship! You do not want to fill the void that leaves your marriage to this new person. Even if you are not having intimacy with that person, you can be creating a special connection, sharing common interests and activities that unite them even more. Ask yourself how you would feel if your wife had a friendship like this. I intend to re -make you in your marriage. I suggest that you are transparent with your wife and let him know your concern and how you feel with the distancing. Ask him that you would like to reconnect, suggest some ideas and spend time to them. Make time in your agendas for you, make an effort to lunch together, and communicate during the day, even with texts. Remember that marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits and many times responsibilities kill fun. END"}
{"prompt":"I do not know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger. That is really the only one i feel.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Well, then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you have!What is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings? Your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feel.Sometimes the family in which someone grew up, did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they were.In some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind. By knowing where your difficulties started, you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelings.Also, spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are. Often, people who have difficulty in expressing themselves, suffered shame and humiliation as a child. They have a chronic sense of worthlessness, and feeling worthless certainly works against self-expression. By having a good time being with yourself, you may increase your self-appreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating. END"}
{"prompt":"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I cannot get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am sorry you are going through this problem of scary thoughts in your mind.None of us are able to directly stop thoughts from coming.What is possible is to question their value, accuracy, and believability.Maybe if you examine the thoughts which upset you, you will be able to feel better by understanding that the thoughts are not very relevant to your actual life.Also, another choice of what to do with the upsetting thoughts, is to redirect them. When a stressful or frightening thought shows up in your mind, give it a happy resolution.  Basically, turn the fright into something pleasant or at least bearable.I hope this helps you at least a little bit! END"}
{"prompt":"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I love to see tears! There is an old saying, \"The eyes are the windows to the soul.\" External emotions are a pretty good indicator of what is going on inside the person, and if tears are present, that often means the person is processing (i.e., moving forward) through their emotions! I am more concerned when I do not see tears from my clients because that can mean the client is \"stuck.\" So, do not feel bad for crying! You are moving through your emotions to a place of healing!

{"prompt":"I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" you can learn lots of skills\/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that \"talking\" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but are not really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy are not ready to laugh at you. What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness\/anxiety help are important steps. Good luck! END"}
{"prompt":"I suffer from checking and cleaning OCD.

{"prompt":"I am so terrified of having sex anymore because I have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection. My partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex, and honestly, I want to give that to her.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maybe you will feel less fear by understanding that whoever told you sex was dangerous, was wrong.If this message came from your upbringing, then it may a deeply embedded belief.Since the belief itself instructs to avoid risk, and overturning this belief requires taking the risk to believe the logic that reasonable safe sex measures are adequate protection, give yourself time to absorb this new understanding.Talk w your partner about your psychological difficulty because their patience will help you. END"}
{"prompt":"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they are gone, I feel sad. It is been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you are wondering how to be happy by yourself. Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so. END"}
{"prompt":"My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. She then started to act younger than she is.    Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she does not act her age. I do not know why this is happening. Is this normal?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your daughter is fortunate to have an observant parent, who is willing to seek out help in this regard.Regression can be indicative of some stress in your child's life, so the issues she is facing should be examined.Seeking advice from your daughter's pediatrician, as well as a practitioner familiar with adolescent issues or perhaps play therapy can equip you with insight into the causes of the behavior, and give you tools to assist your daughter in learning age appropriate social interactions.

I do not know why he will not do them with me. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ask him!Having a conversation about sexual satisfaction increases emotional intimacy.Not only will you potentially feel more deeply connected from a sincere conversation about your sexual questions, maybe this increased emotional closeness will inspire the sexual closeness you wish to receive.

{"prompt":"I have been seeing this guy for a little over a year. Back in August, he asked for us to step back for now. Since then, he has still been in contact with me every day. We spent some time together over the holidays, but then I was gone for New Years with family. I came to find out that he put himself on a dating site. When I found out, I asked him about it, and he responded with this: My apologies if I got my signals crossed, or if I was not honest with you. You have helped me tons this past year and I am glad you are in my life. I did not realize you were still interested in dating. Again, my apologies. Also, is it better to say that I want him in my life or that I want him as part of my life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other. Do you know what type of relationship you want with him? A friendship only,casual dating,or an exclusive relationship? I would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling. Ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well. Be mentally preparedfor a variety of responses from himso that there are no major surprises.By clearing the air and learning what your own and each other's desires are, you can then move forward with a plan. Without that clarification, there will likely be false assumptions, unanswered questions, and confusion.  END"}
{"prompt":"I am a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I was not clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he is not the one God planned for me? We are so young, but that does not stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. I am incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake. Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends.But it is not the end of your relationship or God's will for you.Have a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be. Talk to a counselor or your priest\/pastor. Get someone to be your guide and mentor. Check in with them regularly.Getting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationship.Have a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation. Group dates, public places and no alone time where temptations might arise.Forgive yourself and move on. END"}
{"prompt":"My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant. I do not know what to do to fix the relationship.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been, or more importantly you have felt that he is. This will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyone is perception can be different. Remember that relationships take work and take communication. END"}
{"prompt":"I am going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I am worthless and how I should not be here.\n   I have never tried or contemplated suicide.

I am relieved to hear that you have never tried or have contemplated suicide, but not being able to sleep, feeling worthless, and like you should not be here are big issues that need addressing.Please get around to counseling.

He would always flirt with me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Well, as disappointed as you may very well feel from hearing this guy's answer, you know he does not want a relationship.What type of move would you like him to make?If you mean you would be happy to have sex with this guy and not a relationship, then wait for as long as your patience allows.To wait for him to change his mind that he does want a relationship, does not have a very strong base on which to stand.Its possible to do this only consider the emotional price of your frustration to wait for someone to change their mind.

{"prompt":"I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I am scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms. It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us. You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden. We are all in charge of the choices we make. No one makes us do something other than our self. We choose how we internalize and react to situations. I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward.  END"}
{"prompt":"Me and my adult daughter just do not get along. She is very belittling to me when I do not agree with her. It is almost like she scolds me. We get into all out war. She is said I do not support her in what she does and that I have never loved her. She calls me horrible names, and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughter's comments sound, there is also a message in them about how she genuinely feels.To some degree, your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the other.Developing ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel, would probably help a lot.One major point to be aware, is that the mother\/daughter relationship dynamic, because it is strong, may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adults.Watch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority, instead of considering her as a grown person.The same is true of your daughter. She may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she is.Her needs from you are real, they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way. END"}
{"prompt":"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you do not admit to. Employers can \"suggest\" or something \"stipulate\" in continued employment with them for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships. No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile. Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.

{"prompt":"I am in my mid-twenties now, and my boyfriend of seven years and I want to start a life. My mother is 100% codependent on me and is extremely manipulative. She suffers from type 1 diabetes, which she uses to guilt me if I ever leave her. The problem is that I will feel guilty.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Focus more on your own life and less on the very heavy descriptors you wrote to describe your mom.All the words you wrote represent psychological conditions which are either lifelong or take a lot of motivation and effort to change.Since the only person who can change how your mom handles her life, is your mom, and you are the only one who can do the same for yourself, devote more energy and time to living your own life fully, despite the emotions you feel regarding her. END"}
{"prompt":"I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. How can I fix my underlying issues?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi there. It is great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you do not lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right?What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, \"I am too pushy\", can be rewritten as, \"I am assertive and I go after what I want.\" It can be hard to do since we tend to get \"stuck\" in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that is not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You have already taken the first step, so keep moving forward. END"}
{"prompt":"I started having anxiety three months ago. I am new to having anxiety, and it is making me depressed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" . . . . . You Could Also Contact Your Physician Or A Psychiatrist to Discuss Medication Options If It is Too Challenging To Begin Basic Self-Care. How can I control my anxiety? One of the first steps to handle anxiety and depression is to establish a good routine of personal care routine. Start with the most basic things: eat balanced meals, sleep 6-8 hours at night, and exercise at least 30 minutes a day. This will help you regulate the chemical unbalance that affects your mood, in addition to giving you time to vent and distract you. Since the established ETA care routine is a good time to start exploring the source of your negative feelings, and explor them through therapy. If it is difficult to start creating a routine you can consult with your therapist to identify motivations that drive you to start. You can also contact your primary or psychiatrist to discuss medications that can help you handle these symptoms and start basic care. END"}

I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The simplest answer is that love feels good, obsessions do not.Love deepens a sense of peacefulness and security.Obsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandoned.One suggestion is to study more about yourself and why you would feel so ill at ease when you are not w this person.

{"prompt":"She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and did not remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She does not remember that. I do. Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now I am not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Was either parent abusive or violent toward you?You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life.One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships.A lot of what you have lived through is extreme, either as victim or perpetrator.If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him, would calm him down, do so.At the very least, you will be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him, and fear of his retaliation.

{"prompt":"He said he would try and he never did. It is been nine months, and this is making me worse. Today, he said I have to respect whatever decision he makes. Is that true? Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cannot handle what I am going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? He is constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The fact that you mention that he is \"constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out,\" suggests that Discernment Counseling might be a really good fit for you both. Discernment counseling is a protocol for partners where one or both are not certain they want to remain in the relationship. It is a brief (1-5 sessions) and intentionally focused on helping partners talk through (primarily individually) their reasons for and against staying in the relationship - as well as confront their own contributions that lead to the relationship crisis. It is aimed at helping the couple reach a clear understanding of which path they are going to take, not asking anyone to change just yet, so it can be a lot less intimidating and more to the point than couples therapy. You can look to find a local therapist providing this service here.That said, I agree with other respondents that if he is deciding to leave, seeking out support for yourself would be incredibly helpful.You may need to accept his decision, but you can certainly feel whatever emotions you have.You are allowed to feel exactly how you feel, and it is likely you will be sad, or angry or hurt or disappointed or scared, or any combination of any\/all of those.Having someone there who can validate those emotions and help you to process the grief that naturally comes with the end of a relationship can be a huge help in finding a place of healing and regaining a sense of self, a sense of hope.

{"prompt":"I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. I am not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and does not keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.\n I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I do not know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard! It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship. And you are right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partner's interest. Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you are feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful - and it really can be just about finding the way to share what you are feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called Self-Help for Anxiety Management. There is so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful, and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety. The best part is, it is free! END"}

Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for sharing your history. You do not have too many issues to address in counseling. It will help to prioritize what you would like to work on first in therapy. Your therapist will create a treatment plan with you, which can always be changed while working together. Therapy is a process in working towards your best life, and you deserve it. END"}

Sounds like the part of you that knows the RIGHT thing to do won here! I am so proud of you for admitting that you lied to your Mom! Sometimes lies come out of our mouths before we can even catch them because we are trying to say what the other person wants to hear. I bet that, as you begin to show her that you are not going to lie any more, she will begin to gain trust in you again! Be open with your feelings with you Mom - she is there to support you, guide you and love you! Give her lots of hugs - and give yourself one too for being so brave! Be Wise! END"}
{"prompt":"We have been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker. I do not know how to approach this situation. How do I ask him about it?.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It is based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca END"}

I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to. \n\nWhat could be causing this, and what can I do about it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For starters, know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their lives. While this can certainly because some embarrassment, a diminished sexual esteem or relationship problems, it is important to know you are not alone. I am going to move forward assuming that you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems that may be related to this. Assuming that is the case, for most this happens for two primary reasons. It is either a short term biological shortage of blood flow to the penis. This can be caused my diet, lack of exercise, even stress. Another primary reason for loss of erections are anxiety. Have their been recent relationship issues? Are you feeling as though you are not satisfied in the bedroom? These are just a few aspects that can cause subconscious anxiety and loss of erection.

{"prompt":"I have recently thought that i could be transgender but I have never had the mind of a girl.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello Frostproof,Thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different. This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues. From what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the \"labeling system\". While labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify, they can also feel restrictive or confining. Instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification, explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you!

Feeling intimidated by another person is very unsettling.Stop having contact with the person.Bullies only interact with others either by intimidating someone or by themselves feeling intimidated by someone.Bullies do not have the same dynamics as everyone else.No one can convince or persuade or talk a bully out of their behavior.The best protection for yourself, assuming you are not being physically threatened by the person, is to close contact with them.This does not take away any of the disappointment or sadness of wishing for a better relationship with the person.Until the bully wants to interact differently with others, only harm can result from contact with them.Step one is to stop the bleeding, then to assess and learn to live with not having the person in your life.

There is not really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder, but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment. Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience, how frequently these physical symptoms happen, what is going on for you when they tend to happen, and how frequently\/intensely you find yourself worrying in general.Anxiety itself is a really natural thing - it is just when it starts interfering with your ability to \"do life\" the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders. It might be that for the most part, the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual. Working on your own or with the support of a counselor\/therapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms. This two-fold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way you would like. END"}

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi,Break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. Recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. It is important that you do not compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery:1. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them.2. Although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, & vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that is what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That is exactly the same when it comes to emotionalpain. Take care of yourself, keepyourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.3. As much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. And also block Social Media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind.\"4. Once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. In a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. Now it is time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.5. If possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindsetand forget your ex even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.6. In addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, I would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist. END"}
{"prompt":"My ex-boyfriend boyfriend and I lived together. He had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her. One was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. They are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. He has nothing to offer me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Attica,This is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they cannot forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know is not good for them.In your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. For some people, honestly, it is a game... to see how much power they have over you or it is their need to control you. If you do not want contact from this person, it is really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (\"Do not contact me again\"), and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you do not want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me\". That is great self-talk.But let us get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it is because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those \"good old days\". The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what they are eventually showing you is who they are and what they are capable of. People do change and grow, but it will not happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.Another reason we cannot let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It is as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and has not demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone is poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance. END"}
{"prompt":"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I do not know how. What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. Overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another. Sometimes we come across something that scares us, we push through it and suddenly we are not afraid anymore. But sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them. There are some options:1. You can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment. What kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing. For example, if you have a general phobia about something, they may use various techniques to help you manage it. 2. There are different websites and even some self-help books that you can use to try to overcome your fears. When it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias, exposure therapy well-studied and proven to work. A therapist would help you with this, but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself. I am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself, but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools. http:\/\/psychology.tools\/anxiety.htmlSome colleagues may offer you some other types of advice.

I am sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there is not much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more: it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you do not agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship. I would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed.Here is some info that might be helpful to you.https:\/\/abuseintervention.org\/sandbox77\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/How-to-Help-a-Loved-One.pdf END"}
{"prompt":"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I cannot get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here is a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we do not pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I do not have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it is just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought. END"}
{"prompt":"I have a mother who is still running my life even though I am almost 30 years old. I want to move out and live my own life, but it feels like as long as I do what my mom wants our relationship is okay. It is never okay if I do not do what she wants.    I do not know how to start making my own decisions and not worry about whether it is right in her eyes. Would it help for me to talk to someone about this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" ABSOLUTELY. Having someone who is outside the situation and, even more so, with knowledge and experience in human behavior and relationship dynamics such as a counselor can do wonders in helping us feel less alone in frustrating situations like the one you are currently stuck in with your mother. A professional can also assist you in finding some assertiveness techniques, communication strategies, and coping skills to help you find your voice and stand your ground in a way that feels most authentic to you.In a healthy parent-child dynamic, there comes a normal developmental shift when, as the child reaches each new stage of maturity and responsibility, the parent backs off to provide a more supportive role instead of directive role. We call this \"redefining relationships.\" (We also do it with our friendships and colleagues here and there over time as needed). It is absolutely vital.Sounds like your mom may have missed that memo.Like many parents, she may feel your behavior and choices is a direct reflection of her. Or that her role as your mother allows her greater latitude than it should. Or like many other people in general, that her way is the ONLY way.Regardless, this is YOUR life. And as far as we know, it is not a dress rehearsal. You certainly do not want to wake up some 50 years from now regretful or resentful.That being said, there are certainly ways to show her love and respect while doing what makes you happy.I would encourage you to Google therapists near you whose bios resonate with you and what you are looking for and start on a the journey towards a new chapter of freedom and hopefully a deeper, more satisfying mother-daughter relationship for both of you.Warmest regards,Tamara Powell, LMHC END"}

How can I get over this feeling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First step is to remove the label of your behavior as a syndrome and instead understand the reasons for it.\"Imposter syndrome\" sounds like a name someone made up to write a book and have lots of people buy it because it gives the feeling they know themselves by calling themselves this name.Instead, consider your own unique qualities including your fears of being recognized as adding value to people's lives.If you were told growing up that you are worthless, or if your chosen career goes against family advice and expectations, or if you simply are a shy person, then these would be the starting points to understand your reluctance to believe in yourself.The more you understand yourself and trust the truths you find as to who you are, the less you will feel fraudulent.Good luck in your career work!

{"prompt":"I have known my boyfriend for several years. We were friends for a long time. In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts.    Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he did not seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan.    After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he was not apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. I do not know what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented with:Several breakupsNot holding up his end of the bargain regarding workLack of empathy for your miscarriageLying about his involvement with another womanPhysical violence, which is of most concern.This seems to be a very unhealthy relationship. In my experience, relationships such as these rarely become positive ones. Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning (you looking through his phone), it is indefensible. You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself, Is this really someone I want to marry? Is he an asset to my life? I think you will realize he is not.Best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness, dignity and respect. END"}

It is so important to us that when we feel alone - it can feel almost unbearable. You are not alone in feeling alone. While it can take time to build deep relationships there are moments in each day where we have the opportunity to interact with other people who may also feel lonely and scared and want to be seen and acknowledged. I wonder what it might be like for you if you took on an experiment of trying to really see the people around you and make little attempts to acknowledge and connect with them - fellow humans on this journey of life. A \"good morning\" at the bus stop or really looking at the person who you buy your groceries from or thanking or complimenting someone for something that you notice and appreciate. While this is not a substitute for close relationships these moments of real connection with the people who we share our communities with can go a long way to realizing that we are not as alone as we may have thought.

As painful and aggravating as having parents who fit this description, you are better off to honor what you realize than to continue fighting what is not in your hands to change.Since you write about having a similar problem with friends, then maybe this comes about because you pick friends who are similarly unsatisfying to be with as are your parents.The first step out of this dilemma would be to accept how crummy you feel about the way your parents are toward you.If you are able to live with the sadness and resentment of having parents who do not want to know how to understand you, then you will start to develop a new and more satisfying definition of what you expect from the behaviors of your friends.Trust yourself that what you feel and see is accurate, then it becomes easier to trust and welcome new people who are formatted differently than either your parents or your friends who sound very similar to your parents' ways.

If seeking another career opportunity is not viable, there are a couple of things you can do to manage stress on the job.1.

I know it can be difficult to step away from your desk to eat lunch or take 10-minutebreaks during the day, but prioritize this if you can. Sometimes 30 minutes of downtime and fresh air can help you feel better.3. Have a ritual to end the day: If you commute by car consider an end of the day playlist. Take a walk. Light a candle. Clear your desk and write tasks for the next day. Whatever it is, send a signal to your brain that it is time to end the day.4. If you do work from home or are expected to be availableafter hours, set boundaries where you can. Set a timer for answering emails and stick to that. Have phone free meals.  Try to engage in activities that are rejuvenating like spending time the friends and family. 5. Try to limit alcohol\/ drugs. Move as much as you can. Get outside in natural sunlight.

{"prompt":"Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.  How can I fight this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons, especially fall to winter. Everyone suffers with some form of this (lessened activity levels, increased isolation, etc.) while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. If you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. It is important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools.2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. It is easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D. Light. These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies, as well as the release of growth hormone (which releases when we wake up).

If you have never had these\nfeelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew\nabout yourself. \nMy guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this\nstarted is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the\nconnection. \nI have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It\nis really hard to say since I do not know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will\nshare you with you some thoughts. \nSome people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really\nsurprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them.

It is important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body & mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us, which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals, like adrenaline or cortisol. So, one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety, such as fear, stress. negative thought patterns, not enough food or sleep. Keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills & techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep. One quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes, sometimes this is called belly breathing. When you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates. Many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath, and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress & anxiety . END"}

Another thing that might help is to talk with a friend or family member. Sharing special memories of the person you lost can help you to grieve.If you would like to pursue counseling I would suggest doing an internet search for grief groups in your area. Sometimes hospitals or hospice centers will offer them for free or low cost. You can also do an internet search for non-profit counseling clinics in your area. Many cities and towns will have a non-profit clinic that can provide low cost counseling, it might be worth checking into. END"}
{"prompt":"How does a person start the counseling process?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First, identify the areas that you need help with. What are the issues that are most troubling you? Are these situations creating an impact on your daily routine?Second, do some research as to the type of counselling service you are looking and that would best suit your needs. Are you looking for individual sesssions, couples\/family sessions, etc. And research potential therapists in your area that focus their counselling approach on your therapeutic needs.Third, contact the therapist (most do not answer the phones, so leave a message or send an email). Do not be affraid to ask questions. You want to make sure that this professional is a good \"match\" for you and will work with you at working toward your therapeutic goals (the things you want to address\/work on during the sessions).Fourth, have the expectation that, depending on the issues, you will need multiple sessions\/appointments with the therapist to really address the issues and work toward your therapeutic goals.It takes strength and courage to reach out for help, but I know you can reach your goals. It takes time, patience, and practice do really address your needs.Good luck! END"}
{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal. That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact. In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings. Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what is already taken place and want things to be different. The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits\/patterns. Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment.Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question.Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events.Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression. The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. END"}
{"prompt":"In middle school and high school, my friends and family thought I was gay. I tried telling them, but they would not believe me. It almost feels like they wanted me to be. Now I am actually starting to believe them. I know I was not back then, and now I am not sure anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Use this time to explore who you are...imagine what your life would be like if you were gay and not, ask yourself what is different? What scenario do you find yourself gravitating to? What is important is that you are happy. My message to you is that you do not need to define yourself with your sexual preference or feel the need to label yourself, especially if you are confused and exploring what your sexual preference is. END"}
{"prompt":"Nothing we have tried has worked so far.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum. If you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend, you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy. You could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable. After doing this for nonsexual touching, it can also be used with sexual touching. Looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help. END"}
{"prompt":"I have attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger, and memory problems. I cannot work. I have no income. I am on medicine, but I feel worthless. I want to be normal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling. It sounds like you have had a traumatic experience that has impacted your life in many ways. Without knowing much about your history, I wonder if the trauma you suffered has lead to the anxiety, anger, and memory problems you are dealing with, in addition to PTSD. I would encourage you to look for a trauma therapist who offers a sliding scale or pro bono services. There may also be community mental health services in your area that offer free therapy if you are eligible for grant. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I do not know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents would not like it. My parents are very religiousthey are Christians. We did things every time he would come over to my house. We did not have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we would watch movies by ourselves.\n   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he is not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how is he is not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They are always yelling at me about how I should not date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I am kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I do not talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I am deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I am still with him, I cannot do track and they will not support me. They have also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I am actually very happy with him. They also say I am living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what is best for me and love me because they adopted me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is(if you have not already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and lettingthem know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from therelationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not followtheir rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper.Not everyone will always approve of the choiceswe make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you. END"}
{"prompt":"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I am a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I am beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I have been happily married for almost 35 years.\n   I have never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Usually people who struggle with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. These symptoms come about as a result of underlying causes. The obstacles you have been overcoming such as abuse, cancer and insomnia likely bring about similar feelings and emotions in you which affect your self-esteem. Counseling is meant to support people who have layers of difficulties. We see the difficulties as layers to an onion, peeling away the many layers. END"}
{"prompt":"I have no idea what happened. I go places and do things but still feel lonely. I honestly have no friends, and I am always the one texting people and bothering people. I feel invisible, like someone that no one wants to be around.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situations.Is it possible that at this time period in your life, being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your life?If \"yes\", then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time, even though to some degree being alone is not your first choice.At the very least, since you are not happy with being the one who texts others, then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you first.Also, most relationships are not forever. Is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity? END"}
{"prompt":"I have always thought that there was not much good out there for me. Now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone. I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and I do not know how to process this. It is bothering both of us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You are in a lot of good company and it is great that you are in a positive relationship. Congratulations!I often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem. We often seem to blame ourselves for not \"loving ourselves\" enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem. It seems to me that since we are essentially socially beings and in fact, need each other for our survival, we really know who we are through our many interactions with others and with our environment. In other words, you cannot just snap your fingers and voila! now I love myself, where there was an empty space or self-doubt before. We grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us. Allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship. You are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world. What a marvelous gift for you!You may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable. These fears of loss may get in your way, however understandable. If you are truly close to your companion, you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it. Such a conversation may bring you both closer.Hang in there. You are working on co-creating a new normal with a great woman. END"}
{"prompt":"I am in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I will not want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i am not worth knowing or i am never going to do anything right.\n   Are they right, am I depressed?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would not necessarily say you are clinically depressed based on\nthat first paragraph in your question. Because that could describe more\nintroverted behavior (people who feel more energy from a more internal approach\nas opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others.) It is more\nin the second paragraph that I would be inclined to say that further\nexploration is definitely needed. The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder is\nmore than just those two symptoms, but there are more mild forms of depression\nthat can be equally damaging to someone if left untreated.However, one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone who\nfeels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having a\ntherapist know them, and even less worthy of being helped. Do you feel that\nmight be you? If so, could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture,\nand all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself, and realizing that\nthoughts and feelings are not always rational (in that you are worth getting the\nhelp)?My recommendation just from the information would be that you seek\nout a supportive, listening ear in the form of a therapist, who can allow you\nthe space to express some of these difficult experiences, and help you name FOR\nYOURSELF, what your struggle is. To empower you to name it for yourself, as\nopposed to everyone labeling and\/or judging you for it, might be an extremely\nworthwhile start for you. END"}
{"prompt":"I have felt this way for  two years. I feel so much better now then I did when it started, but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of de-personalization is quite normal for everyone, it will come and go throughout life, kind of like being on a roller-coaster, \"here it is, then it is gone not to return for quite some time\", like many things, the more that you fixate on it, the more stress it will cause you, consider it part of life, accept it, and move on, now if your having many, many ,many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at, but for the most part nothing to worry about.

He also began to be distant and sexually selfish. We had a argument, and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer. He will not treat it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry about this life-altering situation that both you and your boyfriend are going through. To be sure, this is a devastating and lonely road for both of you. I say lonely because when things like this happen we often do not know what to say to each other, and so we suffer in silence with little support.Here are a few thoughts that I am having, and perhaps others will add things, too:1. By the sound of your main question, it seems like you have every intention to be there for your boyfriend during this difficult time. I am not sure if he is willing to talk about his health situation, but letting him know that you want to support him and also need his support may be helpful. 2. If it is possible, see if he would be willing to go to a counselor with you. There are many things that a counselor could focus on that may help your relationship, but also help you both cope with what is happening.3. If he refuses to seek support, you may want to consider going on your own. If you cannot afford it, sometimes hospice organizations offer support groups and other services. It is very important not to neglect yourself. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}
{"prompt":"In the last ten months, I have been kicked out, moved around three times, worked many jobs, stopped school to make money, had dad and mom get sick, was cheated on while pregnant, lost my baby, had relationship issues, and was betrayed. I cannot get a job. I have no friends. I feel lonely and isolated. I have been dealing with all this by myself.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over. If you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day, this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices. For example, you say you cannot get a job, but I wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job, like Career Link. You say you have no friends currently. Are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact with?You mentioned that you have no friends. Is there anyone in your life that you can talk with, even if it is not someone that you consider a closest friend? END"}
{"prompt":"My daughter did not see her biological father for the last three years. She does not want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter has not shown up for the past three years' worth of supervised visitation?Or is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughter?If no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up, no one has even asked where she is, why she is not present, then I do not see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter, than the father is willing to make for seeing her.If your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist, then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or not.The one move I would avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place, being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past, of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated.

{"prompt":"I have been with my boyfriend over 3 years. He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. He is physically and mentally abusive towards me. I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything.\nI am always there when he needs my help. He tells me although I help him does not mean that I am a good person. He always discredits me as a woman and it is hurtful. I spend most day crying and feeling lonely. I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That sounds like a very hurtful situation. Unfortunately, without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change, the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop. I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship. As an abuser, his goal is to control you whether it is through mental or verbal means. I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing, transportation, and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship. There is help out there and you are not alone. If you need any additional resources in your area, please do not hesitate to contact me. END"}

They are not easy to handle, especially under tension and frustration.Sending lots of good wishes for future happiness! END"}
{"prompt":"I was a victim of an incident. I have been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because I do not feel anyone honestly believes me.

Think of a time when you felt safe, comfortable, happy  basically a positive and safe moment  while holding onto the rock. Then, when you have scary thoughts, you can hold on to the rock and remember the happier place. Try to associate as many happy and safe moments with the rock as you can. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a teenager, and I know the importance of my upcoming schooling. However, no matter how much I put in my best effort, my family thinks I have done zero effort in total. What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your family's opinion is quite demoralizing.Unless you are lying to yourself or to them, then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from family.The family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effort.Maybe they target onto you their unhappiness in some other area of their lives. It is often easier to create false narratives if a person wants to avoid looking at themselves.Possibly too, the family people may have a twisted logic to their words, as though ignoring your effort is a way to force you to do more.If you feel the family people will listen to the way their words affect you, then definitely tell them.If not, then you are learning an early lesson on how not everyone is necessarily supportive of others, and how disappointing this feels.

{"prompt":"My husband does not trust me for some past we had. I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that I am messing around, which I am not.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship. Trust, as you clearly know, is essential to healthy relationships. Past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances. We tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security.Rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties. On your end, you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy, gestures of transparency (e.g. - giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with, letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities), and more patience and empathy for his fears.On his end, he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you, attempting to control you, or limiting your freedom.If you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life, I would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist.

It is such a strong word. However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control. I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients. Try and see if it will help. You will be surprised at what you learn about your self. END"}
{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I have been going out for about a year. I suddenly find myself jealous when I see him talking to other girls. I have never been this way before. I do not like these feelings. He said that my jealousy would cause our relationship to have problems. I told him I cannot help these feelings. I do not know where they are coming from, but this is how I feel, I tried to stop, but I cannot. I really like this guy, but I am afraid that I am messing up the relationship. It is just stupid.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Trust is at the top of what makes a healthy relationship. It sounds like you may benefit from personal counseling to explore where this jealousy comes from and what keeps you from having complete trust in your boyfriend. This is not stupid, this is your mind telling you that there is something that needs to be worked through. Sometimes we need to talk to someone like a counselor who is disconnected from our life to understand our feelings and what they mean in our relationships. END"}
{"prompt":"The last of my emotions belong to my pets. Today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow. If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says \"here lays my emotions. R.I.P.\" I practically have no emotions left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my family's. What is wrong with me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about, your pets.  I do not know what all is going on in your family, and I cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind this.I would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills.  We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us.  If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing (like your pets) then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress.  It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends, hobbies, games, etc.  Develop other things that you care about and are passionate about.Another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you do not have healthy ones, you may develop some very unhealthy ones.  You have to cope somehow, right?  Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.I do not know if this is what it is like for you at your house, but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children. One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything. The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability. People need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe.  Both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life.  Please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse. END"}

It can be difficult to handle such a transition on your own. I work with clients to understand their needs and wants.

I do not want to lose her friendship. What do I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Do you and the brother to whom you feel attracted, ever see each other or are in surroundings in which the sister\/your friend, is not?If yes, then this gives you the chance to find out whether you and the brother actually do like each other.If no, then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact you are attracted to the brother.Find out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brother.Anything is possible from, she would like to warn you about qualities in her brother which you may not know and if you did, would not like or react negatively.Or, if protection is not your friend's reason, then maybe she is fearful to lose your friendship if you start a relationship with the brother.Friends are people who care about each others' lives.

{"prompt":"I have no self control over food. Most people stop when they have had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I am never done eating dessert.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello! I am so glad you decided to write in today. This is such a great question and I am sure many others will relate to exactly what you are describing. There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern.First, I think it is important to understand food is just food. Food is meant to nourish our bodies, provide us with energy and yes, sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures, we place a LOT of emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and every celebration. What is more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every get-together. And if it is not? Well, then forget about it!I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office, and it is almost like donuts have never been there before! Must eat one (or two)!However, we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence, or similar ones, will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the office donuts have happened before, and they will be there again on another day. During these moments, I like to have my clients employ a Stop-and-Think method. Stop-and-Think about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting you where you want to be? Also, I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut? If the donut really is a special donut (from the best bakery in town and you have never been there before) then now might be a time to have the donut. But if not, it would be wise to pass and wait until that \"special\" donut.Another aspect we need to remember about food, is to think about what we are getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other emotions? Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment? What ELSE is going on? This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting the emotions, we can then determine where they are coming from, as well as how to decipher them. A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record.The most important thing to remember is that \"food addiction\" can be a real problem for a lot of people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start, please seek out help. Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands.There are lots of free resources and information on my website at www.maddenwellnessky.com. In addition, I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and I would love to help!- Amber END"}

{"prompt":"It is been like a couple of years that I have been feeling like this. I do not want to self-diagnose, but I get so sad and cry and then I feel better.

Bipolar disorder isgenerallycharacterized by extreme changes in mood, ranging from mania (highs) to depression (lows). There are different types; however, so here is awebsite thatgives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder: http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression?page=2After reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider ora counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management. For example, some people may not get regular sleep, but proper rest is important for bipolar management. A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make.The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it does not mean that things cannot get better. There is currently no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well.Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

I do not know what is wrong with me and why I feel this way. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What you are experiencing is anxiety, it is actually quite common. Good news - you are not alone in this experience! That being said, it can be so frustrating and upsetting to have to contend with the anxious thoughts that come up in our heads, sometimes without any warning. Additionally, nighttime is a particularly vulnerable time for a lot of people wherein anxiety rears its' ugly head even more so. We are not as distracted at night and our resources are more depleted so we cannot fight back against these thoughts as effectively as usual.It can be helpful to externalize our anxiety, give it a name, like \"Judy\" or \"Bill\" for example (or perhaps something more sinister like Lord Garmadon??). The naming is all up to you, what comes to mind for you when you think of your anxiety, now what is a name that is fitting? The act of externalizing separates us from the anxiety a bit and makes it a little more tolerable. If you can think of your anxiety as just something else to handle rather than it being a part of your personality, this is usually helpful.Additionally, I recommend not avoiding the situations that make you feel this way. Our brains have to learn what is an actual threat and what is not. Right now, your brain thinks that crowds are a threat, if you can practice some deep breathing and stay in the crowd, you will start to teach (or rewire) your brain, letting it know that the crowd is not dangerous to you. Think of your brain as an overprotective parent. Your brain is overreacting in these situations to try and keep you safe. It just needs to learn that the situation is not a danger to begin with.

To begin, it sounds likes your primary concern your desire to speak to someone who takes your mental health seriously. You have tried talking to your parents and your friends and neither have made that connection in the area you need. I am sorry to hear that. it is unfortunate. However, I think a couple things can be done to try to address this.If you want support1) Parents- Sit down with one of them and tell them with all seriousness that you need to talk about something that is affecting you deeply. Perhaps speaking to both can be too much for one room. If you try to speak to mom or dad by themselves, it may create that intimate atmosphere needed to understand where you are coming from.2) Friends: Like parents it can be difficult to speak to your friends about challenges with your mental health. When you are feeling down and anxious, friends can be great help or not their at all. With friends, it may be one of those things where you also need to create an intimate environment with one friend to speak to about your sadness and anxiety. If anything,speak to the fact you are hurt and help them understand that if they cannot understand the depressionIf you do not want supportCoping Strategies: Identify coping skills and strategy that help you when you are feeling down.Ideas:A.)

People cry, laugh, rage, rant, and talk during counseling sessions. Part of the therapy process is to look at your feelings, and to feel what you are actually feeling (instead of what you think you should feel). So if you need to cry, that is ok. If you feel embarrassed because you cried, or if you feel anxious that you might cry, well those feelings are ok as well. Your counselor can help you manage your feelings so that you can attain your goals, and your counseling session is the perfect place for that. END"}
{"prompt":"She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds as if your ex-girlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you. There are lots of levels of relationships, from a basic acquaintance, to a more friendly acquaintance, to a friend, close friend, best friend, early romantic partner, committed romantic partner, and many more.If she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings, it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but are what are called open-ended questions, which ask her to provide more information. During this process, it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal, but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective. After you have done this for five minutes (it is a rough estimate, but basically until you can restate what she is saying and she says you have it right), you can switch so she is asking you questions about how you are feeling. The goal is not necessarily to change the outcome, but to learn more about yourselves and each other.Then you may have an idea of where you stand in each other's eyes. END"}

Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been depressed for quite a while. I have been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. He is honestly the only person I trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. I cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. My insurance has a $5000 deductible, so I am screwed. I have had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. I have no one. My family does not care about me; they kicked me out when I turned 18 a few years ago. I had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. My ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it is own little tool kit.Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you have written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways. The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization.If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as \"Mind Over Mood\".

She does not have the desire. She is also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I will cheat on her. She does not know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and did not know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt \"ehh\" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We are married and we have a baby on the way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That sounds really challenging for both of you. Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict. I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that is not as arousing as is possible. There are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships. END"}

Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor. END"}

Is this considered emotional abuse?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maybe this is emotional abuse.It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself.Maybe at a time when he is not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness, if this is true, to discuss questions he has about your gender.There is no guarantee he will not start yelling midway through a dialogue like this.

By living with your mom she is not going to stop her attempts at what you perceive as \"controlling\". There is no use in trying to debate or get her to \"see your point\".

Managing 1 child by yourself is difficult, but twins is a whole different ballgame. Anxiety can affect us at any time anywhere. This is the challenge, especially when we have so many things to manage each day. There are several methods and practices that help manage and even reduce symptoms of anxiety. It will depend on what works best for you. Talk with friends, a counselor, or a loved one who can offer you support and feedback as you navigate this process of learning what works for you. When all else fails; make sure you are in a safe place, pause for a deep, cleansing breath in, a long exhale out, and ask yourself, \"What do I want in this moment?\" Now you can begin again. END"}

I have worked with a number of young adults in their 20's who have had to move back home after college , or even stay at home through the college years. Bottom line is that either way , it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be , to have to live at home.  I have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home , they suddenly feel like a \"kid\" again . The old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults !I would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like \"I am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here. I really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until I get on my feet , and I want to be respectful of you and our home ; at the same time , though, I feel like it is important for me to have more independence than when I was younger because I am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous. Can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can both live with ?\"If she is receptive , maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of \"guidleines\" that feel fair to you both .  If this is too hard to do alone , perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of \"compromise contract.\"  This is not an easy situation , but if you can approach your mom in a calm and \"mature\" way and suggest a planned, structured discussion that does not take place in the heat of the moment , your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live with.Good luck !!Elissa Gross END"}
{"prompt":"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.

He was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal, and rather horrific inner struggle.In my work with CCT, or Contextual Conceptual Therapy, (see www.suicidetherapy.com) I have learned how trapped suicidalpeople are in their own isolation, also called a \"mysterious isolation,\" a form of self protection which cuts the off from their Self, or spirit. And unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotionalpain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their Self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others.Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer. They take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live. END"}
{"prompt":"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As you say, if he does reply it is hurtful. But, if he does not reply, it sounds like it is just as hurtful (though more in my opinion in terms of the longer-range effects on the relationship). The behavior he is exhibiting would easily pass for \"passive-aggression,\" as it is manipulative and controlling through passive withdrawal behaviors. And I can assure you that you are not alone in struggling with how to deal with it. So many do, and that is why it gets done so often, because it can. For example, if you push for connection, he stonewalls even more. You probably become more distressed.Frankly, if you and your boyfriend were sitting on my couch in therapy, I would likely say that the behavior needs to stop in order for the relationship to continue, because of how severe it sounds (an hour of withdrawal because someone cannot deal is reasonable, as everyone can shut down from time to time, but this feels extreme and is extremely hurtful to you.) I might even say to him that the behavior needs to stop if he ever wants to be in a healthy, loving, connected relationship. Because the amount that you describe him disconnecting severely hurts trust and security. One of the first \"change events\" in Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy is for the person doing the withdrawing to be able to use words and communication to help the partner understand what they are experiencing, so the burden does fall more on him at the beginning. It becomes the partner's job to tolerate though whatever his experience is.There is no one \"tried and true\" solution to working with passive-aggression, but I would most advise limit-setting (like I would do in our session). In one way, shape, or form, in order for the behavior to stop, there has to be consequences to it. The more you tolerate it and allow him to come back to you when he is done with his silent tantrum, the more you encourage the behavior because he is getting what he wants. END"}
{"prompt":"How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you are asking the question, then probably you are pretty close to ending your relationship.Make a list of what you do not like and then decide whether you would like to tell these topics to your boyfriend as a discussion about your relationship.He may have similar feelings and together the two of you may figure out new ways to be loving with each other.If you have presented your needs and no change results, then ask yourself if you can be happy with him, given what you now realize about him and your feelings.

However, I have been attracted to much older men since I was even younger than that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distant.If you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know you would have liked more and did not receive this, then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within you.It is ok to like older men.Just be sure you are not idealizing them, or anyone else.Because regardless of age, a relationship is based on who the two people really are, not how we would like imagining them.

There are a few different types of Bipolar diagnoses in the DSM (diagnositc and statistical manual) and the best way to find out if your experiences would meet that diagnosis would be to meet with a mental health professional. You can also look up the diagnosis online and see if what you are going through meets the criteria.One question that I would have for you is, what would it mean for you to find out that you meet the criteria for such a diagnosis?

{"prompt":"I start counseling\/therapy in a few days (I am freaking out) but my main fear is that I will cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Lots of people do cry in session, but your therapist will not be uneasy with this. Crying is a natural response and it also releases toxins, so some might say it is necessary! Remember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if there is something that feels too uncomfortable, just say, \"I am not ready to talk about that.\" Your counselor wants you to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place. As you get to know your therapist, you will feel more relaxed and even not worry so much about how you appear to them. It is normal to be anxious going into a new situation especially when you might not feel in control of uncomfortable emotions. Do not give up, go and put your best effort in!Hope that helps,Allison END"}

I believe most government agencies have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) where employees can talk to a therapist about any issue, not just work-related, for free (up to a certain amount of sessions).I am wondering, though,why your coworkers would tell your boss this if it is not true.

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" . . . . . . . How does therapy end? How does a counselor decide when to finish the Ministry sessions or to finish working with a patient? In order to determine the end of the counselor's relationship, we must understand the goals and parameters of therapy. Usually during the initial evaluation, short and long -term goals are identified with the client, and the client is discussed as those goals will be reached. During the therapy process the counselor reviews the goals monthly or quarterly depending on the frequency of appointments. Since the therapy goals are reached, there is a closing session and the client can finish therapy. In some cases the client can identify new goals for therapy and determine whether the same counselor you other counselor can attend you. The counseling relationship may also end by not conforming or violating the parameters established for therapy. Both the counselor and the client can end the therapy relationship. As mental health providers, the directors are obliged to provide a reason for the conclusion of the treatment and provide referring to apply, customers do not need to provide an explanation, although it is advisable to discuss it in a closing session.

I do not know what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How did you find out that the girls are not happy with their dresses?Did you hear this directly from one of them or is this third hand information that someone else told you about one of the girls in your party?The answer matters because gossiping instead of directly telling you about a problem, is a problem in itself.I suggest a conversation with the entire group of girls in which you tell them how you actually are feeling about their opinions about the dresses.One topic you may consider bringing up is what everyone expects to get out of the party. Are they coming because they like one another and wearing a dress in which the girl is happy, is only one way of having fun together?You may learn a great deal as to the difference in values about a quinceaa among you and your friends.I hope you will have a fun party!

{"prompt":"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.  Now he is depressed and hopeless again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined, how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel.Give yourself some time to concentrate on how you have been affected by your husband's suicide attempt.  Even if you decide against immediately telling him how you are feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.Is your husband talking easily with you?Do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?The ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.Depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking one's own life.

{"prompt":"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I do not know how. What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This answer could be very different depending on the fear, the degree of it, and what it connects to.I wonder the following:On a scale of 1 to 10, how upset, anxious, or scared to you get when you think about overcoming this? If it is more than a 5\/10, I would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your area.A lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was self-protective and important. Do you know where your fear started? If you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way, talk with someone (like a therapist) about it.If it is something that you know is irrational (for example, fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing), is there some part of that that you are not afraid of?I really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time. If it does, consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to you.Also, the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you do not want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction.

{"prompt":"How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That you are questioning if you should end your relationship with your boyfriend tells me that you are unhappy with him.

Your partner demonstrates a clear disregard for your needs. There is evidence, as you suggest, that there is addiction here. I recommend seeing a therapist who can help you sort out where to go from here. END"}

I have depression, which I have been struggling with since a young age.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I understand that at times it is difficult to share with our parents what we have been trough, due to fear of judgment or punishment; but I have noticed that keeping our experiences secret, intensifies them. And Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can haunt us for a long time if we do not learn to process the memories that because those symptoms. If you have been victim of a traumatic event that you are not prepared to share with your parents, it is important that you seek help with a counselor, therapist or psychologist. Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great technique to cope with physical symptoms, you could also use Narrative therapy, Creative Therapy or Journaling as a way to express memories and process them with your therapist. A psychiatrist can also prescribe medication to manage the symptoms, but is very important that you address the trauma so you can heal and go back to live your life. Many organizations like the United Way (2-1-1 in many states) offer resources and referrals to put you in touch with mental health providers, you could also talk to your school counselor, doctor or church to find referral that could help.Tip: You do not have to tell you story to each person you ask for help, you can just start by asking for a counselor referral.Cmo puedo superar el Desorden de Estrs Post Traumtico sin que mis padres se enteren?Comprendo que muchas veces puede ser difcil compartir nuestras experiencias con nuestros padres, muchas veces por miedo a que nos juzguen o castiguen; pero he observado cmo mantener un secreto, lo vuelve ms fuerte y difcil de manejar.

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated:1) Client has met therapy goals2) Client is not progressing3) Therapist is not a good fit for clientIn order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made, the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessions-by-session to determine what is helping, what is not, and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals. When a client has met their goals, that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to check-in periodically to make sure that they are still on track (sometimes referred to as relapse prevention).When a client is not progressing, and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail, than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client. In these circumstances, referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea. END"}

{"prompt":"I am planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it is hard. Sometimes it is not a physical need, it is mental.\n   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Quitting smoking can be difficult. It is also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way. From the way that you wrote this, it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically, but still have cravings.One thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or OB\/GYN about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings. Sometimes that can very helpful.As far as the more emotional or mental piece, these things come to mind:Sometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy. There are sometimes toys, like those available at Office Playground, that may help to keep you physically occupied.There can also be changes or additions to your routine because I imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time. Maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette, you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead. The list is endless, but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise (with the permission of your doctor) just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well, completing a puzzle, learning a new activity that requires using your hands (painting or knitting, perhaps).Another piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes, perhaps irritability. Depending on what it is that you may be feeling, learning other strategies to use can be helpful as well.This can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change. I would recommend that if things do not become easier for you, consider talking with a therapist. Then you could not only have some more strategies or ideas directly related to you, but you could have very direct support for what you are trying to do.I give you a lot of credit! END"}

Obviously something has shifted which you do not understand. Therefore, perhaps you should consider attending Couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings? It would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on. Communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection, or shut down connection. IMAGO dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection. END"}
{"prompt":"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he would never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he would not do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I did not like this. For our New Years resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on boardno more drinking every night.\nThe other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I could not wait). I asked him if he would come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleepit is a dead giveaway he is been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. \nI am not sure if I am overreacting or not. I just feel like I am so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty.

His ignoring of what you are talking about, does not mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.

It may be helpful to talk to someone who you trust to get a sense of whether the changes that you are making are those that are considered adaptable or important changes that allow us all to grow. Another possibility is that you are changing things in an effort to get away from something that is uncomfortable or difficult. There are many other possibilities along this continuum.I would ask you to consider the following:What is leading you to want to change your job?What feelings are associated with this change? (Happy, sad, scared, anxious\/nervous, confused, motivated, etc.)How is the job that you are looking to transfer to going to be better or different? Are the concerns that you have now going to travel with you?If you are hesitating to get another perspective (from trusted friends or family or some sort of career advisor in your area), where is the hesitation coming from?

Arguments have arised from this single issue many times.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Do you know what you are afraid may happen if you do speak up?Usually people do not talk freely because they feel afraid to do so. Sometimes the fear of being rejected by the other, of being criticized or judged by the other person, or that what you will say stirs anger in the other person.If you are able to know what your particular reason is for not talking, then maybe you and your partner can talk about what makes talking easy or hard.Also, since speaking up is new for you, then ask your partner to be patient while you learn to do so. Everyone does better at learning new skills when they feel supported and welcomed. END"}
{"prompt":"I am currently living in a hotel and I do not have a family.  I met a guy a month ago.  He is a bisexual.  He has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites. He would not help pay for the room.  When I asked for the TV remote control, he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it. I slapped him and asked him to leave my room.  We recently just got back together.  One time I was sick.  He came to visit and feed me but left no money.  Then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that I have struggles living at a hotel.  He says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever I need someone to have sex with.  He left his bath soap so he could come and get it.  I think that he is trying to find a way to come back.  Please help me.  What is going on?  I am a good, loyal woman.  Why is he treating me like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends, than about how you feel is treating you. You are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation. If you have friends to talk to, please reach out. While this man has money, it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together. It sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected. I would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care. This is not your fault. But you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs. Take care. END"}
{"prompt":"I am in a relationship, but I feel like I am always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and that is lingering in the back of my mind.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both: that you matter. Sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you do not matter. That is why it did not work with him by the way. He was not reflecting to you that you mattered. However it ended, clearly though that is the sentiment that is lingering with you. So here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message. Move on. You are not unworthy, you just have not found a man who is worthy of you!To be worthy of you, he must see your worth. Often though before anyone else can see your worth, you have to believe it. END"}
{"prompt":"I keep being mean to my best friend, and I do not know why all the time. I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time. Could that be a because?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Morristown,There is a saying that goes \"hurt people hurt people\". It is possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mother's behaviours. When we are treated poorly, especially as children, it affects how we ourselves, others, and the world. It is also powerful modelling of aggressive behaviour.The good news is that you have this lovely awareness and I think a desire to learn about yourself and grow in your ability to be respectful to people you care about. I recommend you consider sitting down with a therapist and exploring these ideas and moving forward on that path you seem to want to be on. Good luck! END"}

Think about why you feel so shaky - is it something about the therapist or their style? If so, it would be a good idea to talk with them about it so you feel more at ease.

{"prompt":"I have been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now. I am a young adult, and right now, driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety. I cannot ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on. I have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me. I miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack. My family offers little to no support. They think it is fake or \"all in my head.\" It makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where I would rather never wake up anymore. I am not self-harming, I just feel meaningless. This constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life. I was such a happy person. I want my life back. I want to travel with my friends and family again, but I do not know how. I have almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that I will live with this anxiety forever.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Not having support from your family for such a significant problem, is a problem itself.How about your friends, are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that you have got this problem?Are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now you have got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger?Maybe being and feeling accepted while you are in this current phase of your life, would help diminish the panic attacks.If no support is coming to you, then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others, especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time.Its possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourself.If no one wants to show they care about this situation, then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyone is wish that you be better, while they ignore your need for their support.Be realistic in what you are able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional need.Thinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone. Eventually, you will stabilize within yourself and know that all you are asking for is some support for having a tough time.Hopefully, the others will be more responsive to you.If they do not you still know that you are being reasonable for what you would like.

{"prompt":"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It is almost as if I am a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I do not need to tell you that this is an incredible amount of serious stuff to happen in a short period. When we go through a trauma, it is natural for us to shut down as a way to protect ourselves. A kind of freeze response. Think of a possum or a gazelle. These animals go so far as to physically freeze in protection. Our emotions do the same thing sometimes. We feel shut down and that can be strange---a kind of disconnection. This does not mean that you are sociopath or that your feelings will never come back. The amazing thing though is that as time moves forward we naturally heal and emotions come back. If you feel stuck, seeking counseling is a way to help accelerate this healing and help you work through and begin healing. Wishing you the absolute best! END"}

Then if the thing I wanted to do does not work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out. \n\nCan you explain what is going on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind - so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development. You are not at all alone.You have taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware! The more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts, the more you can learn to manage them. Your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try - for example, identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response, such as taking a deep breath, informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space, or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk. Since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out, you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as \"I am responsible for my efforts\" and \"Blame is not helpful for anyone\" and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight. When you practice thinking more rational, healthy thoughts, you are actually rewiring your brain, so practice is key! END"}

Are you and your husband able to talk directly about your feelings? The way two people connect is usually by talking with each other to understand what each one cares about and thinks.Your current emotional suffering is the natural result of being married to someone who shows no interest in doing this.If your husband wants to start talking with you, then there is a chance the two of you can reconnect. If he does not want to participate in the relationship with you, then start to think if its possible and for how long, to get emotional support from friends and family who do care for you.Also a question for the future is to understand what the value of your marriage is to you besides having a connection to your husband.

{"prompt":"Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn.A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group.Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer groupAsk a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own.I encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like, \"Hey, I noticed something,\" or \"Let me help you be successful.\" By showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help.When does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still, professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also, parents should pay attention to how the child's social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety.The vast majority of children who define \"quality time\" as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call \"social reciprocity,\" then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company.

{"prompt":"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" After meeting a client, many Counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for. This assessment is required by most insurances and allows the Counselor to give a diagnosis, which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the Counselor. If you are paying out of pocket, this diagnosis is not really required for payment, but many Counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us. The better we understand what it is that bothers you, what you would like to get out of the counseling, and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues, the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals. How the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the Counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling, and that information is too much for this little post.

She has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly. \n\nIs this something I should be concerned abou? Any advice will help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Have you asked your daughter why she is doing the behaviors you describe?Often the best way to find out why someone does something is to simply ask them their reason.Her answer will give you some guidance as to next possible steps.If she is pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels, or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problem.Ask if she is noticed any change in the way she walks. Maybe she does not know she is doing this and maybe she feels embarrassed to tell you she is doing something a bit odd.Since usually 12 year olds do not color, is it new that she started coloring?Maybe given the fact of messy handwriting, she is in a phase of pretending or reflecting on good times as a young child.Then this becomes the topic of examination.Does she feel insecure about being on the cusp of adolescence?Some of these questions can be asked directly and some are for you to first decide based on what you know of your daughter, which questions and what direction to take in understanding your daughter's motivation.

I feel like they are not going to keep me anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Getting your first job is an exciting, terrifying, and challenging experience. It is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker. You are literally \"learning as you go\" in this completely new environment. You are going to make mistakes. You are not going to get it right the first time. It can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work. A couple of things to remember here: 1) You are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it, 2) There is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work, 3) you know best what you need in order to be successful. These three items can be helpful to remember, especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully. If you feel like your supervisor is approachable, meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you, let them know you are nervous about doing a good job. Also let them know how you learn new tasks, information, or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand. Becoming a successful worker does not happen overnight, but each day you can identify what works for you and what does not by communicating with your work team, the easier it will be for you. We all had a first job once, and were all worried about doing well. Hang in there, and call a counselor if you need more help. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s. I find myself wearing pantyhose, heels, skirts and other women's clothing in private. I am torn on how to feel about it. I enjoy it very much. I have had a pantyhose\/stocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young. I have no history of sexual abuse growing up. I am currently single.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you enjoy cross-dressing and are comfortable with how you feelaand aware of your own thoughts and feelings about it in private as compared to in public, I see no problem with that.If you would like to become more comfortable with it or express more feelings about it, I recommend that you see a local mental health professional, not because there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but so you can learn more about yourself in the process. You may find that doing this in private and having a partner who accepts that is your view of how you would like things to be. You may discover that you would like to do this in public.I appreciate your honesty. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it will not last.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it is characteristics. See if you relate to those characteristics. I have a feeling you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly. For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss. Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues. END"}
{"prompt":"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is encouraging that you say you want \"to be better connected with [your] husband,\" and since he has not left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You do not say whether he complains or not, but even if he does not it seems there is a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you will need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving.A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels. END"}
{"prompt":"My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him. I also was dealing with an abusive relationship (mentally, physically, and emotionally). Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people.\n   How can I feel more comfortable around other people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your life.Have you told some of the people in your life about the many changes you have been through?  It is possible people sense something different about you and are not sure whether to ask or not ask questions.Also, understand what type of qualities you would like to offer and receive in a friendship.  Given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time, the way you socialize will change.Start with one person whom you are pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your life.As a result of how this interaction goes, how you decide to spend your time together, what you will discuss, you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other people.Then, you can consider if you are ready to add others into your world.

{"prompt":"Does counseling really do anything that can help people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A counselor can do a few things that can be helpful:1) Give you a space where you can explore what is in your head without worrying about being judged or punished.2) Help you better understand yourself, your choices, your motivations.3) Give you tools and information you can use to help create change in your life.Ultimately, though, it is up to the client to take action, because action is what creates change. So, a counselor cannot create change ... but they can facilitate and support it. END"}
{"prompt":"I have bipolar II disorder, I am addicted to alcohol and weed, and I am hopeless. I keep drinking even though it is harming myself and others.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You may feel hopeless but YOU are not hopeless. Addictions of any sort are difficult to overcome, especially when they serve to bury pain and suffering that one is experiencing. It is not impossible to overcome alcohol or drug use\/abuse\/dependence on your own, but you will likely find much greater success with the help of a therapist or other support system such as rehabilitation or Alcoholics Anonymous. I suggest doing a bit of research to see what type of helpis available and feasible for you in your area and go from there. Know that recovery takes time, willingness, and effort. Do not give up and remember that you are not hopeless. You can make the choice to change your habits and learn new ways of healthy coping. Best of luck to you! END"}
{"prompt":"I recently broke up with my boyfriend After being together for over 4 years. I truly believe I did the right thing, but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself.\n    I am seeing someone casually and I am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation.\n   How can I learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career, relationship status, etc?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Moving on from a long term relationship can be difficult. Sometimes we can lose a sense of who we are because in a way we have become defined by the relationship itself. So, when we begin to move on and see other people, our sense of identity may be obscured. The tendency is to seek out validation to give us a feeling of worthiness.  That it is ok to move on and be happy.  This is a relatively normal reaction. It is important to treat yourself with kindness and compassion through this time in your life. Mindful self-compassion can be a great way to begin the process of getting that sense of who you are back and what you want in a relationship. I think its important to look back, learn what you can from the previous relationship, and become a better person for it in the future. At the same time, taking the necessary time to nuture yourself on a mind, body, and spirit level. Self-compassion allows you to turn inward and except all facets of who you are. It improves your capacity for love, vulnerability, emotional openness, social interconnectedness, and self-respect. My philosophy is holistic, collaborative, and accepting. The cornerstone of my treatment philosophy is mindfulness and other evidenced based integrative modalities. I work as your ally to help you cultivate abundant self-compassion in your life, so that you can have the types of relationships you want. END"}
{"prompt":"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment. When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself. Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy. Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones. END"}

{"prompt":"I am a peaceful person, but I often find myself having thoughts about killing people. Eventhough I like the thoughts at the time, they make me cry. Why do I feel like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware exists.Sometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others, imagine if they do the opposite of love, which is to kill, that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving way.This is my theory, it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamic.Most important is to keep an open mind to self-discovery on your feelings, including the ones which are uneasy, such as killing, to consider. END"}
{"prompt":"I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like  they just want nothing to do with me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As long as you try to reach others expectations you will never feel satisfied or accepted. How about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those. Make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic.  END"}
{"prompt":"I am an early 20 something year-old virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids. He is cheated on me twice: once in the beginning and then four months ago. He was not use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he was not sure. We both work at the same job (where we met) and it is with the girl that works with us. I have been trying to get over it, but now my confidence and self-esteem are low, and sometimes I feel like he will do it again or that he is not ready to be with me. I think about it all over again when I see her. He says he is in love with me, and with the last time he cheated, it did not feel right, and that is when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me. He is contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because he is in a relationship with me.\n   How do I gain confidence? Should I let him go? If I let him go, I do not want to be sad about it being that we work together. I try to tell myself I am beautiful every day, and I think I am a pretty attractive female with a great personality, but I do not like the fact that she works there.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationship.You are on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriend.Since he was the one who broke your trust, he is one in the position of earning back your trust.This is always a basic formula for couple's therapy in which there has been infidelity.Understand within yourself whether you would like being with your boyfriend and what you would like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationship.If yes, then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationship.For example, some people who are getting over being cheated on, would like knowing details about the affair person, some people want to see the phone of the one who cheated.Recuperating after a cheating incident takes many months.If he tells you he would like earning back your trust, give him some time to see if there is progress in this area.As results unfold, you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally taking.About the girl at work, she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationship.She has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to take.As you go along this road, more than likely, you will be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kind of returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what is up. She says she cannot connect with anyone and that it is not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I am very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I do not know. It just feels like something is really off.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Grief has a huge impact on us and everyone is reaction is different. The one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves. Her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up until she passed. It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you, or anyone else, is likely low right now. Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it. If she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track. END"}
{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Everyone has different experiences going to therapy. Being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel. Emotions are our body's way of telling us important information about ourselves. I would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this. That way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor. There are probably underlining emotions (fears or insecurities) that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions. Your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety. In individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors. As you address your issues, then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship. END"}
{"prompt":"Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family.\nHowever, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt. I am not sure how to move forward?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" To begin, I am sorry to hear about your situation. Like many of the professionals have stated, infidelity is a very difficult obstacle to move forward from. It is not impossible. While forgetting is probably the hardest part, forgiveness is something that can and will happen. There are things you can do to help yourself.The first this is identifying what you feel is best for yourself and your children. That means being honest with how you feel being in this relationship on a daily basis and understanding how it is affecting you.Second, how is your relationship affecting the children. Do you feel that by staying in the relationshipthat it is affecting your daily interaction with them. If so, that' something to keep in mind.Next, Really looking at the pros and cons of staying in the relationship. A specific breakdown of what benefits come with staying and what are the ramifications. Vice-versa for leaving. Include your partner. I think being honest with him and letting him know what you are thinking is could be a great option. At least you are not keeping something inside yourself to manage. Rather, you are being transparent to them. Sometimes a couple can come to an agreement that it may be time to end things and other times it may be best to keep moving forward with a serious plan to how to move forward. Regardless, if you cannot trust him and that feeling will never go away it is time to address it. Couple therapy can be beneficial as well as a therapist can provide professional counseling to you.Earl Lewiswww.RelationshipsGoneRight.com END"}
{"prompt":"I have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. I really want to stop it and enjoy things.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency. Human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people, places, and things to let us know more about ourselves. We also have an inner voice, dialogue, conscience, etc. that helps us to determine the path for us. Often, when someone is worried about the external feedback, and focuses on this as the sole source of information, it can create a dependency that can become problematic. Balance is key to so many things in life. Your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek. Do not discount it and rely only on the voices of others. END"}

{"prompt":"I am in a high stress position for a tech company. I am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety, but also demoralizing.\n\nWhat can I do to manage my stress?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Recognize your reason for continuing to work for this place.Sometimes \"overworked and underpaid\" is tolerable because of the valuable learning which the person will take with them when they have decided the time has come for these lessons to end.Or, are you in this place because it is an easy commute to your home or fits well with other parts of your life such as education or some health related program?As long as you have a good reason to be there, you will feel there is good purpose.If there is no good purpose and every day you wake up to work for a place you cannot stand, then its time to look for a new position.

{"prompt":"I am 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I am attracted to her and she is under 18?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" No, that is perfectly normal. You are under 18, too. You are only a year older than she is. This is absolutely normal. What would be wrong is if you did anything to her against her will. Always remember that NO means NO, respect her, respect yourself, and be a normal teenager! Have a healthy relationship. Holding hands, kissing, and more should only be done when both are comfortable with it and agree to it. Although it is frowned upon by a lot of people, it is no secret that teenagers do have sex (even if their parents and perhaps religion would definitely not want them to do it). Only you can make the choice that is right for you. Just be responsible in the choices you make. Some states have laws on what age is old enough for consensual sex. You would be surprised how young those ages are. A 14 year old having sex with a 20 year old would be against the law, but someone the same age as her, or just one year older is not. \"Wrong\" can be defined in a lot of different ways, though. Is it against the law? No. Is it against your religion? I cannot answer that for you.You can, however, have a relationship that is not physical in any way. It is okay to just be with her and enjoy her company. You can hang out, watch movies together, go on dates, do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing. Your relationship can be anything you want it to be. END"}
{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In my therapy practice the decision to end therapy is mutually made together with the patient.Otherwise, the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonment.The way you will both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easily.The person's mood will be better, they will smile more, sit in their seat in a more relaxed way, look more at ease, take better care of their appearance.One of the ways to end therapy is to gradually decrease the frequency of the sessions.Sometimes people who are in my practice start to come each three weeks, then monthly, then every three months.This gives a sense of security, friendliness, and casualness to the therapy, and de-medicalizes it as though the person was treated for a medical symptom and the symptom stops completely one day.Talk therapy is about life and life problems usually end gradually.I end my therapy in a way which mirrors the life process in which many interaction and situation problems show their effects gradually and show different effects over time. END"}
{"prompt":"A lot of times, I avoid situations where I am to meet new people because I have a fear of embarrassing myself. I often avoid large groups of people, like parties, because I think they all constantly judge me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who does not like large groups?This is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you are.People have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or small.If you are not afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups.Possibly you can generalize your findings to large group venues.If you try the and are not successful, then likely you simply are not naturally someone who cares for large group settings.Not everything a person does not like is a symptom of something is wrong w the person!

She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am sorry for what sounds like a frustrating situation.For how long has your daughter lived the way you describe and did it start all of a sudden or more gradually come on?What you write sounds like a major depressive disorder and this can start for a variety of reasons and improve in just as many different ways.Start with how you are feeling about the situation. Ask yourself for how long you will be able to tolerate the way your daughter lives and if you feel any satisfaction in your mother daughter relationship.If she is of legal age, and you do not want her to live with you, you have tried convincing her to get medical care for its own sake and to more clearly see her emotional and psychological health, and she is unwilling to take care of herself, you can discuss your options with the adult protective services agency in your state.The first step is to know what exactly is her problem so you can decide if its own you are willing to take care of or not.

I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The first step is realizing your value and establishing firm boundaries. When your parents cross that boundary and are verbally abusive, you have to have a plan to stand your ground and act upon it. That plan may include a better job to afford a place of your own, a domestic violence shelter if you are unable to provide for your needs, a firm talk with your parents about your parental authority, or other. Whatever you do has to be firm or consistent, a boundary that you allow someone to cross is no boundary. There is always a way, if you have no where to go, ask yourself why is that the case(which I am sure you have considered already) and what can I do about it. If you choose not to take any action then you are enabling your parents to remain abusive. Ask yourself too, why am I not acting on my situation. Am I too dependent on them? Do I not want to change? Is it easier just to let them provide for me? Be honest with yourself. You need to work on your self esteem, and things that empower you. Support groups in person or online, Church groups or organizations, friends, books, music, etc.... but think on things that will empower you. Are you stuck financially because of the need for a job? Do you need to go back to school? Do you need training in a new field? There are a myriad of possibilities and answers. Action, think action and Change, what can I change? END"}

Therapy should be a healthy positive experience off g growth.You have the right to look for certain high qualities in a therapist and finding the right one. Each therapist is bound by a code of ethics and clients should have high expectations.

But finding that supportive person that you can share with is a big part of the battle with depression. Depression thrives on being secret, it seems to grow the more we isolate ourselves and hide it away so I am with Laura Cassidy, when she suggests finding that professional support person so you can start fighting back against your depression. If that feels like too big a step right now, maybe check out a book or two... I am a big fan of a book called 'Feeling Good' by Dr. David Burns if you want some practical thoughts on tackling depression and on 'Radical Acceptance' by Tara Brach if you prefer something a little more spiritual.

{"prompt":"I have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi New York, There is no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future, because it is a huge part of who we are. The GOOD news is, though, that the effect does not have to be negative. I am met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently, every day, what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in, and it helps them make really great decisions. You can accept your past, integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way.If you see negative ways in which your past affects you (and this is also common), you are wise to seek professional help. Without knowing more, it is impossible to give you a lot of direction here. Basically, our past creates emotional \"bruises\" that are touch on and triggered by present situations. But our reactions are often about more than just the present moment. I think you know that.I wish you the best as you sort it out. END"}

Why do I feel this way?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" My first reaction to this is that It sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world, that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside, build yourself up on the inside, work on yourself, use positive affirmations daily, it would be wise for you to research some self-construct theory and do some self-concept work.Hope this helps,C END"}
{"prompt":"I am in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I will not want to talk to them for days or even weeks. \n\nSometimes I feel i am not worth knowing or i am never going to do anything right.\n\nAre they right, am I depressed?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have \"depression\".Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future.I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need. END"}
{"prompt":"I am dealing with imposter syndrome in graduate school. I know that by all accounts I am a phenomenal graduate student, and that I am well-published. I am well liked by students and faculty alike. And yet I cannot shake the feeling that I am going to be found out as a fraud.    How can I get over this feeling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you are on the right track. Recognizing these nagging thoughts of self- doubt as \"imposter syndrome\" is a huge step in the right direction. From what you have written here, it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome.  Continuing to remind yourself of what you have accomplished and looking at the facts at hand can help diminish doubt. Remember, many successful people battled imposter syndrome on the way to the top (and still manage it). It might be helpful to read some of their stories so that you do not feel alone. \"The Cut\" has a great article on \"25 Famous Women on Imposter-Syndrome and Self-Doubt\".  Business Insider has a great article about men and the imposter syndrome too. Remember, if you jumped through all of the hoops to get into school and get published-- you belong. END"}

As long as you are in the same state as a therapist offering this service, you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home, even being in your small town. I would recommend looking into this option, because you are asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers.

I do not know how to approach this situation. How do I ask him about it?.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It is based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca END"}

Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is never too late to get help and begin making significant changes and improvements in your life. The right time is when you feel ready and open to change. Sometimes when we have a history of trauma, like sexual abuse, the impact of that trauma can affect many areas of our lives as adults. Working with a therapist who specializes in trauma is a great way to begin developing skills to manage present day life, learn to regulate your emotions and nervous system when you become triggered, and then in a safe environment have the opportunity to process past traumas so you can live your present life with more ease and joy. People can and do recover from the impacts of trauma at any stage in their life. It is never too late and you can feel better END"}
{"prompt":"I have been pushing people away all my life. I finally have a great boyfriend who loves me, but I keep pushing him away and I do not want to. I need to learn to open up.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Figuring out the space we need between ourselves and others is an ongoing and unsolvable task. But it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that. Pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life. Or it may be serving some other purpose. One helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist. Psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the 'pushing away' is serving. It also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction. What were you feeling right before this? Did it provide relief? Reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the 'pushing away' serves.It may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times. This may help him be as sensitive as you need him to be about the pace of the relationship, and to understand what may be happening when you push him away. END"}
{"prompt":"I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety. I also have voices in my head. I have problems sleeping too. I have already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I have self-harmed in the last and used to be suicidal. How do I tell them this and ask for therapy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you have already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those things?It may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past. I do not know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation, but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious (or whichever of your concerns you feel comfortable revealing to them), that may be a way to start the process. As for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal, a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about that.I am not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing, but if you have some support there, perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as well.You mentioned that sometimes you hear voices. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them, that would be a time to ask for immediate help, before you follow through with what they are telling you, perhaps by calling 800-273-8255. They may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call. END"}

{"prompt":"I have never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad does not believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she does not believe me either. I am a pansexual, but I cannot trust my own parents.\nI have fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends do not listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they do not always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi there. Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life. I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents were not listening to me. It is even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in.Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything! Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents, it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress and anxiety in our lives. If we did not, none of us would be living. Anxiety & stress keep us on our toes! Often, I have to remind myself of this as well. However, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our lives.Are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as: deep breathing exercises, meditation or yoga? Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety.Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school, shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in.  Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know, that sounds silly. But, it is true. You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold. Imagine being in the Doctors office and taking deep breaths. This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and\/or stressed. Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards.Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place, closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place. Some people use meditation music as well. If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it!Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. I would not suggest you learning this on your own, if you have never attempted yoga before. Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and\/or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students.Lastly, in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing a letter to them, if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are open on working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue.I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best! END"}
{"prompt":"I am planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it is hard. Sometimes it is not a physical need, it is mental.\n\nI cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Quitting smoking can be difficult. It is also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way. From the way that you wrote this, it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically, but still have cravings.One thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or OB\/GYN about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings. Sometimes that can very helpful.As far as the more emotional or mental piece, these things come to mind:Sometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy. There are sometimes toys, like those available at Office Playground, that may help to keep you physically occupied.There can also be changes or additions to your routine because I imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time. Maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette, you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead. The list is endless, but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise (with the permission of your doctor) just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well, completing a puzzle, learning a new activity that requires using your hands (painting or knitting, perhaps).Another piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes, perhaps irritability. Depending on what it is that you may be feeling, learning other strategies to use can be helpful as well.This can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change. I would recommend that if things do not become easier for you, consider talking with a therapist. Then you could not only have some more strategies or ideas directly related to you, but you could have very direct support for what you are trying to do.I give you a lot of credit! END"}

But here is the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It is the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That is the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now. END"}
{"prompt":"What makes a healthy marriage last?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couples should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps. END"}

I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I am ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I am not even that old. I have always been a straight-A student, but now I am getting C's and F's, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. It is not even like the work is hard.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Possibly laziness is not the true problem and is only what appears as the problem.Since you describe your laziness as an observable quality, I assume you have not always felt or handled yourself this way.Quite possibly and more likely, the particular conditions of your current life are not ones that are optimal for feeling good about yourself and your involvements.One suggestion is to see if there is any purpose to what you are doing in all the areas in which you see yourself acting from laziness.If you are not able to notice any good purpose, then you may be mistaking \"laziness\" for a significant amount of stress in your life.Stress can be opened and understood. If stress is what underlies what appears as laziness, then you define the contributors to your stress.Not feeling enough support in your life, financial uncertainty, arguments w people who are close in your life, feeling misunderstood overall or by particular people, all are possibilities.Good luck in learning more about who you are!

We usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside. So to answer your question of how do you get to know yourself I usually do a 6 session course with my client by having them answer questions such as the following in the first session: What do I love? (other than your children) What are my own needs and desires? What 3 things have I accomplished in my life that I am most proud of? What are 5 strengths or qualities I have? What is one event that had a major impact on my life? How have that event affected my life today?  For their homework assignment after the 1st session, they are asked to write a letter to self tell self what they love, cherish, appreciate and even admire about themselves. Most women feel awkward at first, but I remind them that the truth is that only to the extent that you are able to love and value yourself, you are to love and support others. END"}

{"prompt":"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.\n\nI spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them. When you cross over from friends to a relationship, it does change things. Some people are very easy going and would not feel threatened by what you did Others would be upset. If your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend, then you need to talk about it. Each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect. Then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship. Maybe he would not be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend. Or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him. Most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward. You did not do anything \"wrong\" because it does not sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend. But if you really care about your boyfriend, then you probably care about making him upset. Instead of looking at this issue as a problem, try to look at it as an opportunity to connect. If you can both listen to each other and understand each other, your relationship can become even closer. END"}

Perhaps you can have a conversation with your husband this and mention that you are asking him questions to learn more about his experience and you can discuss how you notice that things were going much better when he came home from the hospital, and now things are not as good. Perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to him.I also hope that you husband is still continuing with his own treatment.There may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your husband needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again.

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder.  How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Relationships can be extremely enjoyable and satisfying. When relationships end, however, it can be devastating. It is normal to go through a grieving process after a breakup. Denial, bargaining, sadness, anger and eventually acceptance are all normal stages of grief. You may experience these feelings all at once or one at a time. Allow yourself time to grieve by expressing your emotions - talk to a friend or write in a journal. Take care of yourself during this time by exercising, eating and sleeping well and spending time with friends. After some time you should start feeling better. If you feel like you are not feeling better and you do not know what to do, you can see a therapist to help you get through this difficult time. END"}

Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Is really difficult to tell whether he honestly forgot about someone or whether he was really lying again.I do not know whether he would be open to having a discussion with you about your concerns about this and whether you would be actually willing to listen to your thoughts about it.This might be something to discuss with a local therapist so that you can look at the patterns of lying in the past as well as whether you have a way to discuss this with your husband in the way that you would feel comfortable feeling vulnerable with your own feelings and also listening to what his responses are.This is difficult because I imagine you have a react very quickly and strongly to things like this because of what has happened in the past between you. All of this make sense. Having said that, there is also a question of whether he is telling the truth in this particular case and your reaction is based on past events.There is no easy way to know.If you do decide to have a discussion with your husband about it, consider these things:Ask if this is a good time to have a conversation about something that is important to youMaybe you will be able to listen and ask questions about what came up for him (emotionally) when he realized that he did not tell you about this other personMaybe he would be willing to listen to what you are thinking about if you are both able to do so without blaming, pointing fingers, or asking the other person to change. This would just be an exchange of information. Ideally this part of the competition would not be about you saying he did something wrong, but just expressing how you felt when you heard about itIt may be helpful to discuss these things with a therapist first so you have some coping skills for being able to listen to him without being overly defensive and also expressing your feelings without blaming, both of which would be very natural in this situation.

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder.  How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal. That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact. In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings. Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what is already taken place and want things to be different. The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits\/patterns. Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.  END"}

If so, then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back. Couple's counseling would be of benefit. If not, then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from. There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them, the issue is not likely to get resolved. In the meantime, I suggest that when you are feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife says\/does, think before you speak. Ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her. Instead of arguing, try and communicate how you are feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship. Hope it all works out for you both! END"}
{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is a question that is very specific to each person. There are definitely some variables, but I can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:When a client has met all of their goals, at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorSometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timeSometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. This depends on agency policy, but sometimes it is a requirement. If the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician, frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyI'm not sure why you are asking this question, but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. Oftentimes \"discharge goals\" change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients, their goals, changes in their goals, and many other things. Changes are normal, but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind, at least generally, from the beginning. I strongly encourage you to ask about it! END"}
{"prompt":"My boyfriend is seeking therapy. He is in his 40s and has some childhood issues. He has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents, how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children, and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kids.Do not allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured. A relatively qualified therapist would never make this call.Psychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families. You and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children, assuming each of you wants children.Childhood issues, your boyfriend's, anyone's, are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emerge.If the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents, the disappointments and hurt from the very early years, will be replaced by better ways of interacting.

{"prompt":"I am currently living in a hotel and I do not have a family. I met a guy a month ago. He is a bisexual. He has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites. He would not help pay for the room. When I asked for the TV remote control, he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it. I slapped him and asked him to leave my room. We recently just got back together. One time I was sick. He came to visit and feed me but left no money. Then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that I have struggles living at a hotel. He says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever I need someone to have sex with. He left his bath soap so he could come and get it. I think that he is trying to find a way to come back. Please help me. What is going on? I am a good, loyal woman. Why is he treating me like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends, than about how you feel is treating you. You are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation. If you have friends to talk to, please reach out. While this man has money, it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together. It sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected. I would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care. This is not your fault. But you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs. Take care. END"}
{"prompt":"Sometimes I cannot stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I do not like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just cannot get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I do not think these thoughts are normal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your life here matters and being present in it so you feel joy in yourself and your surroundings is important in creating your sense of ease and balance. No one can predict, for sure, what happens after death because consciousness transcends boundaries and limits we tend to impose on it. That said, if reincarnation exists or if there is a heaven or hell your consciousness of it will most likely be free of discomfort or pain as you experience it now. Meditating or doing self-hypnosis for anxiety can help alleviate your thoughts and sense of fear and living the a life of kindness and balance will assure that your future will be happy for you regardless of the unknown.

It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate. You will more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of self-reminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work.

{"prompt":"I have been depressed for quite a while. I have been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. He is honestly the only person I trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. I cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. My insurance has a $5000 deductible, so I am screwed. I have had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. I have no one. My family does not care about me; they kicked me out when I turned 18 a few years ago. I had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. My ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it is own little tool kit.Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you have written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways. The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization.If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as \"Mind Over Mood\".

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Relationships can be extremely enjoyable and satisfying. When relationships end, however, it can be devastating. It is normal to go through a grieving process after a breakup. Denial, bargaining, sadness, anger and eventually acceptance are all normal stages of grief. You may experience these feelings all at once or one at a time. Allow yourself time to grieve by expressing your emotions - talk to a friend or write in a journal. Take care of yourself during this time by exercising, eating and sleeping well and spending time with friends. After some time you should start feeling better. If you feel like you are not feeling better and you do not know what to do, you can see a therapist to help you get through this difficult time. END"}

Pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking life.If you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare, or taken advantage of, or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare, then look for where in waking life, you may feel similar.In this way, you will become clearer about stressors in your life that you may not have realized existed were it not for the stress of nightmares.

Here is a link that talks about the signs of an abuse relationship if you are questioning whether or not you are experiencing an abusive relationshiphttps:\/\/www.helpguide.org\/articles\/abuse\/domestic-violence-and-abuse.htmThis maybe a lot of information to take in so if you feel overwhelmed I would encourage you to talk to a therapist. Also every state has a domestic non-profit that can assist you with support or resources. If you are struggling to find one in your area I can help you. They can help you safety plan and give additional information that might be of assistance. In abusive relationships, unfortunately there is nothing you can do to change your partners behavior. It is up to her to make that decision. A lot of time in abusive relationships asserting your boundaries can put you at risk for more abuse. I would encourage you to use your gut in this situation because you know your relationship better then anyone else. The best thing for you to do is to keep yourself emotionally and physically safe. I would encourage against couples counseling because it can also become unsafe in an abusive relationship. You are making a big step in looking for help. END"}

Here are a few thoughts and ideas:1. If you have not seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It does not hurt to get checked out. If they find the because, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, do not be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are \"normal.\" These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are \"abnormal\" it does not mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression. So remember, the symptoms are the problem, not YOU. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}

Sleeping difficulties, irritability and anxiety attacks all are correlated with these mood disorders. And it is actually quite common for someone to deal encounter this during their lifetime.Also, keep in mind that just because you are experiencing this now does not mean that you will be dealing with it the rest of your life. Many times, it can be a single episode and if treatment is received, you can help prevent any recurrent episodes.However, you may want to first talk with your primary physician to rule out any medical issues that could be causing these problems. There may be a reason for the sudden onset of these symptoms that can be addressed quickly.On the other hand, if it is determined that you are experiencing anxiety and\/or depression without a medical reason, there are two methods that are very helpful in your treatment:#1 Talk therapy with a certified therapistHe\/She will be able to address the concerns you are experiencing and discovering if there is an underlying issue that may be causing it.#2 MedicationThere are many medications that can assist you with the feelings that you are experiencing.

Ideally parents are people who tolerate that their kids are people with their own unique characteristics.Everyone likes feeling loved by their parent.  Do you feel loved even though you and them have clashes?Anger is a symptom of a problem.The real question is knowing what feels like its being hurt inside of you.I agree with your idea of talking with a psychologist or some other type of licensed professional therapist.See if your area has a family service agency in it. Generally the non-profit sectors offer sliding scale fees, and if you qualify, your cost per session would be financially comfortable for you.One possibility is to tell your parents that you would like starting therapy because of feeling so much stress from the family arguing.They may very well be surprised to learn of your maturity in assessing your level of stress and be willing to make a positive contribution to this by offering to authorize therapy through their health insurance.They may even decide on family counseling so all of you work together to relate in more loving ways.Last, if you are not ready to speak with your parents about wanting counseling, think about speaking to your school guidance counselor.

I still love her the same way I did. I have suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. It is damaging me and my life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Boise, I am sorry that you have lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It is different now...you are not together anymore, but you cannot accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You have been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you have not been grieving...you are stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let us look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there is something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you did not have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you did not have the chance to make it right. Maybe there is a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you have never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there is no guarantee it will go well or that she will even respond. Maybe write her a letter and do not send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide.Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that did not work? Sometimes people are so in love that they cannot clearly see that the other person is not in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she is asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they are getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\" Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you have turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person does not love me, then I am unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It is part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that is how I know I am lovable.It is normal to feel sad. I am grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I am clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well! END"}

In order for us to move on, he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he does not want me to do anymore. I am wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if I should walk away.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Dallas,While I think it is healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that, your situation sounds one-sided and rigid. Will you have a list too? There are elements of control here: humiliating you in front of coworkers, saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forward...does he decide when you move in and out? Your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you do not have a voice in this relationship. Do you have a voice? If you are uncomfortable with the contract, are you listening to your own voice? If you cannot hear your own voice, maybe it is time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and want.No relationship is all good or all bad (would not that make it easy?) Relationships do not come with billboards that tell us what to do. They do not come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen (except that past behaviour is a good predictor). You have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now, except clarity, and his control may be what is making things muddy for you. You are too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly. A therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is. END"}
{"prompt":"I was born a girl, but I want to be a boy. Because of my religion I cannot tell my family. I know they will not accept me. What do I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First of all, I want to say, I am so sorry you are not feeling accepted by your family. I know how isolating and lonely this can be. The most important step you can take right now is building a community of supportive people who do accept you. Creating your own sense of community is very powerful for helping you love yourself. If you can find a trans support or LGBTQ support group in your area, I recommend seeking that out right away through your local LGBTQ center or PFLAG. If you do not have access to that, I recommend calling Trans Lifeline US: 877-565-8860 Canada: 877-330-6366 https:\/\/www.translifeline.org\/. You can talk to other trans-identified people anonymously for support, calling them from wherever you feel safe. This is a great way to begin to connect with other people who have similar experiences to you. Next, think of this time in your life as your time to explore your gender identity, just for yourself. Make room to explore you gender identity in ways that are private and comfortable for you. Consider reading a book like: https:\/\/www.newharbinger.com\/queer-and-transgender-resilience-workbook to explore who you are and build resilience. Also, consider learning about other religions that are accepting of LGBTQ folks for another perspective - there are many out there! Once you feel you have a strong support system outside of your family and a positive sense of self-love (which can take time, be patient, do not rush it), then you can consider what action steps you want to take with your family. If you are still living with your family or financially depend on them, having other supports in place first is very important. It is a very personal choice how you want to navigate your family relationships, talk it through in-depth with a trusted friend, other trans folks, or therapist to help you decide what is right for you.And remember, there are tons of people out there who will love and accept you. We are rooting for you!In solidarity,-Lindsey END"}
{"prompt":"I am always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me.    How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Unfortunately you cannot directly change another person's behavior. However, you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you. The best way to provide feedback is in 3 parts. The first part is telling him the emotion you are experiencing when he does not listen, such as hurt, sad, and unloved. I would stay away from feelings such as frustrated, angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion. The second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way, be specific! Example: when I get home and tell you about my day and you do not look away from the tv. Be objective as possible when you describe his behavior. And the last part is the most important, tell him what you want him to do, and again be specific! Example: I would rather you turn off the tv, give me eye contact and reassure me about my day. Here is an example with all 3 parts together: I feel hurt when you do not say anything to me when I tell you about my fight with my friend, I want you to hug me and tell me you understand how I feel.

That is OK, we all have. However, the best way is to say OK, I did it, learned from it, will not do that again. EVER!!! You can get pass it; grow from it. Unfortunately, we forgive others faster than we do ourselves because we hold ourselves to higher standards or expected better behavior from ourselves. It can be embarrassing, hurtful, almost unforgiving at times. But how do you forgive yourself? Take a Deep Breathe..... and then acknowledge that you did something wrong, acknowledge it, and say to self, \"I forgive me\". Just like you would say to someone else. This starts the process of forgiving. Also ask yourself these questions:  What lesson did I learn? What would I have done differently? What will be a trigger that will make me do that again, if I happened to be weak or tempted? Avoid or prepare for those triggers....Forgiving yourself will set you free from the prison you have put yourself in. You would start back living.  END"}

Abusive people do that a lot; they make you believe things are your fault when they are not. You did the opposite of what you fear you did.

But you feel guilty anyway, right?...so putting yourself in that position was only worth it if you allow your loving acts to melt away the guilt. Can you tell yourself \"It is okay that I had to take care of myself too.\"... \"I gave up a lot for my dad; I have nothing to feel guilty about\".Putting yourself last for your dad was a loving thing to do. And... my hope is that you can also find different ways to help yourself feel \"good enough\" in this world, and a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself. :) END"}
{"prompt":"I am depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. Every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. After a bit, I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely. After roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking. Sometimes I find myself causing fights to have change.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One way to know yourself a little better and why the dynamics you describe take place, is to understand the particular dynamics of your life context.Look at your major areas of where you spend your time, whether you are happy with the people with whom you socialize, how you feel toward family members and how they seem to feel toward you.If you examine your relationships and life this way then you may start to notice areas where you have some control or at least a say in how your life is going.If you are socializing among people whom you do not like, have a job you do not like and your family mistreats you and you mistreats them, for example, then anxiety and depression are an understandable natural result.If you make improvements in your life and relationships, even tiny improvements and even the effort and intention to improve, you may find your anxiety and depression dissipating.People usually feel their worst when they feel lack of control in their life.Look for ways you can regain and\/or strengthen yours.

{"prompt":"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I have never felt before. \n\nI feel like I do not  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I cannot discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  \"wrong\" by a lot of people.\n\nHow can I get myself to just move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is no wrong or right way to define a relationship. I believe each relationship we are in is an opportunity to expand and to know self on a deeper level.

{"prompt":"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he did not do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I am falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you. END"}
{"prompt":"I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he does not want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. I am not a sexual person, and he knows that. I want to be with him, but I am not ready for another relationship, and I do not know if he ever will want to be more than friends.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.Suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a person's energy.Stay focused on what you know about yourself, which is that you are not ready for another relationship.From what you describe about your friend, similar to you, he does not feel ready for a new relationship.If and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive, then you will be in a position to find out, either by approaching your friend as a potential partner, or by asking your question of his interest in you.Who knows?It is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship, approach you, and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become, accept his offer.Good luck with Step One, becoming familiar with your new state of single hood, and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship.

{"prompt":"I have been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. She says it is just a crush but I do not know how to cope with it.    How should I deal with this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thanks for writing in. Several things come to mind:I do not know how you are communicating, but there is a great deal of difference between communicating through videoconferencing compared to text message when discussing subjects like this. Being able to hear and\/or see each other will help you to be able to gauge a lot of the emotions connected to what is going on.Are you in a place where you can ask your girlfriend questions about this crush and actually listen to her answers? If you can listen non-defensively and ask questions about what is actually going on (kind of like an investigative reporter might), you are likely to hear about her experience, thoughts, feelings, etc., so you can actually see what the crush is like for her and how you want to react to that.Then you could see if she is willing to listen to your questions and answer them for you.Another tip: Find out when is a good time to have this conversation. If you are talking to your girlfriend after she just worked a 10 hour shift and she is frustrated about that, it is likely that the emotion will transfer to the conversation that you are having even though it does not have anything to do with that.Find a way to keep yourself grounded and centered during the conversation. Notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair. Mindfully play with an object or something like a paperclip or a pen. Doing this mindfully (by being aware of your senses) will help you to not feel so overwhelmed during the conversation.After you have more details, communicate about what it is that you want or wish for. It is often easier to hear and discuss as opposed to talking about something that you need.Remember that while anger is a very real emotion, there is always something else under it. Be aware of what else could be there: hurt, disappointment, betrayal, fear, etc. END"}
{"prompt":"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi there,I hear you, PTSD has a verydebilitating effect on your whole life. I know that from personal experience. Recovering from it is possible and doable!First is step is to acknowledge to yourself that your PTSD symptoms are a normal reaction to an abnormal and traumatic event. The nightmares, the anxiety, the heightened startle response - are all typical human responses following exposure to a frightening event. It is important that you do not blame yourself or your body for reacting this way, rather approach yourself withcompassionand kindness that you would extend afriendwho is hurting.The secondstep is to start taking steps towards healing. I would really encourage you to see a counselor or therapist specializing in trauma recovery so that you have a guided, step by step support. But if this is not an option, you can begin your healing on your own using a step-by-step approach outlined in the book, Healing Trauma, by Peter Levin. It is a very hands-on book and even comes with a CD audio guide. It has concrete exercises that you can do to help you eliminate dissociation, feel grounded, and decrease your anxiety response. I have used myself and with my clients with great success!You can begin your recovery journey now with this video with Peter Levin's approach to Trauma Recovery:https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nmJDkzDMllcOne last thing, I suggest consulting with a nutritionist or a doctor to help you boost your healing with supplements, vitamins, and minerals. The stress from PTSD is very draining on the body, and you use up a lot of energy and resources, so at times of trauma supplements are quite necessary for recovery (Magnesium, Omega 3, Zinc, Vitamin C....etc) END"}
{"prompt":"I think I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and I have anger issues. I told my mom over and over again. She told me she would get me a therapist, but she never did. I just found out that my mom cannot afford a therapist for me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It can be difficult to get counseling if you do not feel supported by family members. There might be a few options. If you are in school, I would recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse. They often will be able to help you access freeor affordablecounseling resources in your community. In addition, depending on where you live, it is also often possible to call 211 for referrals to free or low cost counseling services in your area.I would encourage you not to give up. You are on the right track. END"}
{"prompt":"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes do not know what is real or not. If feel at times like everyone is lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thanks for posting. This is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless; among other emotions due to the uncertainty. You said that, at times, you feel like everyone is lying. Ask yourself some of these questions. What is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying? Where is the concrete evidence that they are lying? How could I test my thoughts about this? What if things are not what they seem on the surface? Am I any lesser of a person as a result of this person's behavior or opinion? Our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave. It is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions. You can start this process by answering some of the above questions. We are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with. As it pertains to if God is a lie; be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that God is or is not real. It may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that. Hope this helps at least a little bit.  END"}

I am wondering what led you to ask whether you made a mistake and whether you wish you were still in the relationship with this guy. If so, is it an option to talk about this with him?If you decide to get back together, consider having some conversations about what your concerns are and taking about five minutes or so to listen to this guy's thoughts, feelings, etc. Then see if you can repeat the essence of what he said to make sure you have it right. Then maybe you can ask some questions that you have and see if he is willing to listen. When each of you is in the role of asking questions, try to ask them as if you are an investigative reporter trying to learn more about each other's experience.If you are looking for information on coping with breaking up and you do not want to get back together or that is not an option, consider looking at how you define yourself and what is most important to you at this moment. I hear you saying you have done a lot of things to make him happy. I am wondering what is making you happy. Hopefully you have friends or family that you can trust and talk to. Even if you do not talk about your relationship with all of them, I hope you have some people around whom you can be emotionally safe and comfortable. END"}

If the outfit was not appropriate then the instructor should tell you--If he\/she did not then assume the swimsuit was okay, but the gentleman in the class wanted your attention and took it upon himself to comment, in order to get that attention. If you do not want his attention then you have a couple of choices--wear a shirt over the swim top, find an inexpensive swim top to replace the one you have, or wear what you have as long as the instructor does not say anything, and if you get unwanted attention say in as confident, slightly loud, voice as you can muster. \"I do not appreciate your critique of what I am wearing, we are here to take a class, let us just focus on that.

{"prompt":"I love him so much, and I do not know what to do.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Savannah, This is a pretty common issue; one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving, yet their partner does not feel loved. There is a great book \"The Five Love Languages\" by Gary Chapman. He explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love, but we do not necessarily all speak the same \"love language\" as our partner. You might feel that by going out to work and earn money, you are being loving, but if your partner's main love language is quality time, you are not hitting that bulls eye because you are not home! The five languages are words, quality time, acts of service, gifts and touch. I recommend couples grab this book, sit down and figure out what their love languages are, and then...slowly...you start to ask for the kind of love you want, and you start to speak your partner's language a bit better. You may never be fluent, but you can get better. The most important part is to understand each other better and to know that there is nothing wrong with either of you, you are just speaking different languages. You can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved. I bet he just needs you to \"speak his language\". :) END"}
{"prompt":"I am a teenager. My dad has been jail for the last five years. It is tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and I. I feel like I took upon a parent role when I am the second youngest, and I am not stable. My mother and sisters say I am overdramatic. I am just so hurt, and I keep breaking down.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you have a lot of weight on your shoulders.I am not sure what you mean when you say you are not stable and you are breaking down. If you are crying because you are sad, that is okay. If you are crying a lot or having trouble eating or sleeping, that is different than just crying sometimes because you are sad. It may be helpful to talk with a local mental health professional in your area. They can help you to figure out what you could do differently to have the role in your family that you would like while also supporting yourself and what you want. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I am trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they do not know that I am suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I am a threat because of it.    I am not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and do not know why I am so scared to be around them.    I do not understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as \"paranoia\" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose,rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them.

Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are never \"too many issues\" to be addressed in therapy. Most people come in with multiple issues they want to address. The wonderful thing about therapy, is that often, as one or more significant issues begin to change and improve- the lead naturally without much effort to improvements in the other areas. (For example, as you begin to address trauma and betrayal from you past, you may find that the insomnia improves). Your therapist, with you input and direction, can help you to prioritize which problem areas to target first. END"}
{"prompt":"It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I would estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.\n\nI believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.\n\nAfter improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First of all, exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health. That is great that you have added this in your routine. Have you also considered altering your diet? Certain foods are linked with poor sleep. For example, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep, especially right before bed time.On the other hand, warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep.Additionally, at bed time it is important to keep your room dim, cool and without distractions (i.e. TV, IPad, Phone). Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy.As far as your nightmares, there could be many causes contributing to them. Certain foods (many of the ones mentioned) or medications could be the culprit. Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender.You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing. Oftentimes, depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep, causing nightmares.Finally, Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep. There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if you would rather not join a class right away.Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Z's!

{"prompt":"What makes a healthy marriage last?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In addition to suggesting this great read from 2016 (but feels timeless):https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/05\/29\/opinion\/sunday\/why-you-will-marry-the-wrong-person.html?_r=0I will give my summary on what the author of the article is speaking to: do not get too comfortable. But, in truth, no one really has the answer to your question, otherwise would not we all have a \"good\" marriage? Also, what even is a \"good marriage?\" What is it that YOU want from a marriage, a relationship, a partner, and what your other-half also wants for themselves, is going to be what defines all of this, because every relationship is different.And in answering that \"what YOU want\" question, you might actually stumble upon what would make for a healthy relationship: vulnerability. You will have to be vulnerable to be able to explore what you really want, and listen to what your partner really wants, as that kind of processing can be uncomfortable. But, with vulnerability comes intimacy, and in most opinions, there is much of a relationship if there is not much intimacy. END"}
{"prompt":"I am planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it is hard. Sometimes it is not a physical need, it is mental.\n   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is very admirable that you are trying to stop smoking for the sake of your health and your child's health. The mental aspect of quitting a drug can and usually is the hardest part. First, it can be helpful to change the focus of your thinking so you are focusing on the healthy behaviors you will start\/improve rather than only focusing on the behavior that you are trying to stop. The reason for this is that our brains hear the main topic of our thoughts. That is, when you tell yourself \"quit smoking, quit smoking, quit smoking\", your brain hears \"smoking, smoking, smoking\". So we need to put together a self-care plan that addresses your thinking, emotions, and behaviors (nutrition, physical activity, and other stress reducing activities). The idea is to have an effective plan in place to both prevent yourself from feeling intense stress (which increases cravings) and to have a well-placed plan for when the intense cravings inevitably present themselves. And lastly, and possibly the most important; You have to believe you deserve to be the healthiest version of yourself. Think about the times when you are most vulnerable to smoke (stressful situations, after meals, when drinking, social situations, etc.). The use of affirmations is also an important resource as what we say to ourselves effects our mood. Repeatedly telling yourself \"i am healthy, \"i am getting healthier, \"my lungs are becoming clear and healthy\" or other affirmations like this. Even if you do not believe them at first, continue saying them. This step is important to improve cognitive flexibility which trains your brain to be open to change. Think about activities that you like to do or that you would like to try and replace smoking with those activities. Any activity that can make you laugh (time with friends, watching comedies, etc.) will evoke a calming response because when we feel happy, we typically do not feel stressed out simultaneously. END"}

I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though.The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not. If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings. You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of. You may find other people have the same interest as you. Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them. Do not hold back with your therapist. Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are. There is no need to suffer with this alone. END"}

Do you want to be upset because you forget how many women work? think about it for a moment. Do you want to determine the trust you have in your husband based on his ability to report the number of women who work with him? If your answer is yes, what reflects that about your marriage? Trust is something that is gained based on our actions and those of those with whom we interact; also in our ability to communicate and understand the values ​​we have in common. If you practice being worried about every small detail in your relationship, this can become an obsession that will potentially damage your relationship.

It seems that you are very attentive to your husband's feelings, and that you want to help during this moment of his life. But it is also important to be aware of your own emotions. How have you felt after this suicide attempt? It is common that negative emotions experiences while recent events make sense. Feelings such as courage, shame, guilt and fear are common, and wanting to avoid, minimize or distance yourself are equally common defense mechanisms. Since you understand and overcome these feelings, you will be in a better position to offer help, remember that your husband must also be experiencing negative feelings. It is very important to have a security plan, this includes removing all objects that can be harmful or facilitate a future attack, know who to call in case of an emergency (9-1-1 or a nearby emergency clinic), have an expert who monitors your progress and that of your husband, can be a advisor you other mental health expert that helps you handle negative feelings and retaining situations. an atmosphere where your husband feels supported and not judged. Use open phrases to communicate, tell him that you are happy that he is with you, and you want to know how you can help him during this stage. also make small changes to improve their quality of life as a couple. Exercise, eating healthier and sharing activities can be a good start. Explore your spirituality and that of your husband can also be helpful, and finding people or groups that share those same interests can be a way of staying motivated.

The feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parent.My suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner, may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship, your boyfriend actually has.These realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand, especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or did not adequately nurture you as a child.A therapist for your Self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest.

What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi,It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes. END"}
{"prompt":"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been married for 11 years. Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. I often feel that my husband has \"friends\" at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. I feel very alone and just uncared for. Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Communication opens up what is called \"cognitive space\" for your partner, and allows them to do the same for you. The more you know about each other, especially your everyday lives, creates a bond between the two of you. Much like the saying goes in the military, the same is true for a couple; \"Complacency Kills\". It is important for both of you to invest in each other on a regular basis. I regularly recommend that both of you take the 5 Love Languages Assessment and start using each other's top love languages to help show each other the positive affection that you feel (or at least want to feel) for one another. Start asking about your husband's day, trying to learn about all the interactions that he has at work, and feel free to ask questions so that he knows you really want to know about him, and know him intimately again.

{"prompt":"My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him.

Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people.\n\nHow can I feel more comfortable around other people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your life.Have you told some of the people in your life about the many changes you have been through?  It is possible people sense something different about you and are not sure whether to ask or not ask questions.Also, understand what type of qualities you would like to offer and receive in a friendship.  Given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time, the way you socialize will change.Start with one person whom you are pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your life.As a result of how this interaction goes, how you decide to spend your time together, what you will discuss, you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other people.Then, you can consider if you are ready to add others into your world.

{"prompt":"Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A lot of times it is not about forgiveness but learning from experiences. As an example, as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk. Then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward. Experiences allow us to grow, find a balance and what to do and what not to do in order to move forward. On the positive side you now know the consequences as for your actions not to take the same course. Forgiveness comes with time as you \"learn how to walk again.\" END"}
{"prompt":"I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I did not have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First of all, congratulations to you on becoming a Water Safety Instructor.As far as how to forgive yourself, this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves, no matter the subject. On the other hand, it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class, you will not see the same people much longer, so hopefully the embarrassment will be temporary.As far as the class, maybe you can give yourself compassion for the idea that we all make mistakes and it certainly sounds like it was not intentional. I think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted direction.Trying to make sure that the same thing does not happen again would probably be helpful, but it sounds like you are already doing that. Something else you could do is think of something you can say to yourself when someone says something embarrassing about that occurrence, such as \"it was an accident and I have fixed it now.\"You may find some helpful tips herehttp:\/\/tinybuddha.com\/blog\/let-go-past-mistakes-6-steps-forgiving\/ or herehttp:\/\/psychcentral.com\/lib\/how-do-you-forgive-yourself\/ .

{"prompt":"Sometimes 3 times a night.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As a depth therapist (aka \"psychodynamic practitioner\"), I do a lot of dream work with clients; and they gain great insights from our explorations.We remember dreams, I believe, because dreams are messages (always in code) from the unconscious, communicating the crux of unresolved conflict between who we are and who we think we are supposed to be. You might be remembering so many dreams because your conscious mind is ready to hear these messages...and make some internal changes in response.Write them down! You will be glad you did. A broad cross-section of these these messages will help your therapist help you interpret the meanings of these communications from you to you, and possibly chart your best path forward toward to resolve the because of psychological symptoms you might be experiencing.

{"prompt":"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. I completely agree with Dr. Zehner. Many couples are in open-typeor polyamorous relationships where one or both partners engage in sexual relationships with others. The key thing about this is that it really does have to be something that both people are okay with. Now, as Dr. Zehner indicated, what may be okay today may not feel okay tomorrow, so good communication is essential.The truth is, even in polyamorous relationships where partners are in agreement, jealousy does sometimes happen. Here is a good article about polyamorous relationships and the issue of jealousy: http:\/\/everydayfeminism.com\/2016\/02\/polyamorous-dealing-jealousy\/This site has many other articles about polyamory. If you type in \"polyamory\" in their search box, you will find some good information. I wish you well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}
{"prompt":"I keep having these random thoughts that I do not want.  Things like \"you are not worth anything.\"  I know they are my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.\n\nWhat is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Those critical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you, at a very young age.When we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us, feels accurate, we absorb their opinions as our own.Your question shows you have reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone else's opinions are not necessarily your opinions.Nothing is wrong with you, everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of view.Start the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which do not feel true.Then replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your own.After a while of doing this you will either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true.

{"prompt":"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I am doing things she finds disrespectful even when I do not mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work \"sweetheart.\" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She does not, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define \"infidelity\". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, \"I feel you distancing from me.\" In other words, it is not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a \"sweetheart.\" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean \"you are so sweet and kind\", \"my dear\", or in a flirtatious manner to mean \"sweetie.\" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, \"I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much.\" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying \"sweetheart\" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she is wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, \"I am sorry.\" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says \"I am sorry\", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner does not do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.

Or, do they object only to electronic communication and do not want him involved in his child's life?Ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend.

{"prompt":"I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I did not have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Everybody does something or a few things in their life which looking back, the person wishes they had not.The key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake, then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doing.Your mistake sounds genuine, not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyone.Now that this student in your class pointed out your mistake, you will learn to notice the appearance of your swimwear.Put in context that feeling foolish for doing something embarrassing means that overall, you generally do most activity in your life, in non-foolish ways.The incident would only bother someone who generally is responsible. The mistake is a contrast with what is usual behavior for you.I hope you will enjoy swimsuit shopping and find a beautiful bargain! END"}
{"prompt":"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I do not know how. What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are, than you realize.  Fears are sometimes irrational so that logic does not get rid of them.Think about whether you felt secure and confident as a child. Also, did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing up?Often these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives. If the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago, then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances, may help you to dissolve the current fear.Another possibility is CBT, cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe, say being a passenger in a commercial airplane, which feels frightening to a person.CBT is short term and results are limited to specific fears. It is a much quicker approach than self-understanding. END"}
{"prompt":"My boyfriend will not touch me intimately, he will not kiss me while we are having sex and he will not have oral sex with me. I know he has done this things with other women in the past. I do not know why he will not do them with me. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First off, do not blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions. Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time).There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that is left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning). It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers. Sometimes I refer to this as the \"hooker-housewife mentality\" where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently; almost up on a pedestal. Drives many partners crazy until they are aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend\/ girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them.It could also be that he is not even aware that he is not doing these things. If you have not asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when you are not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you (or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy). You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him. Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he would be down to go downtown. \"Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.\"If you continue to get the impression that it is somehow only about YOU or that he is just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if he would be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy. END"}
{"prompt":"It is really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who do not put any effort into nourishing our relationship.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One thing I would ask is \"why are you still hanging with those {friends}?\" A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people. I would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends, I always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved, if your in a relationship that is one-sided, it is inevitable that it will start to de-compensate. Never travel with the circus, never travel with fools, everything in life should have some positive payout, will things at times be negative, of course they will, but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity.Hope this helps, C END"}
{"prompt":"I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention. It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" you can learn lots of skills\/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that \"talking\" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but are not really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy are not ready to laugh at you. What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness\/anxiety help are important steps. Good luck! END"}
{"prompt":"How does a person start the counseling process?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I have found that if you go to my website and fill out the form, I can usually get back to you within 24 hours. In my most efficient instances, I have been able to set-up a consultation within a couple of days, which is just 15 minutes by phone, to chat a little about what you might want to work on, how I may or may not be a good fit, etc. Then from there, if you want to meet in person we can set up an initial session. I will usually be able to let you know what kinds of ongoing times for counseling that I have available over the phone. Scheduling is a big barrier to finding a therapist, especially in New York, when schedules seem pretty busy all around.I have heard a lot of statistics about how prospective clients in therapy will often wait for months before reaching out, which is why I think that email is great. Cold-calling can cause an unnecessary amount of anxiety (also, who will hear me on the phone?) whereas email is relatively easy to begin a conversation, from what I have found.I tend to recommend clients give a new therapist a couple of sessions to get a feel for fit. But, if it is horrible after one session, and you feel awful when you leave, that is another story. I might want to explore with you what felt so awful, but if you do not want to come back, that is well within your right.Also, keep in mind that we want to help. So, please do not feel like we are judging you for seeking out help! You are strong for doing so. Far too often I hear about it as a weakness, and that is just BS:) END"}
{"prompt":"We do not have sex a lot. I cheat when we argue. I do not kiss or have unprotected sex with them. It is a one time thing, and I never see them twice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. The question about\nwhether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered\nby you. However, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask\nyourself to help you find your answer:\n1.\nDo you feel like you are violating your own\nvalues or morals? This is important, because we all have different values and\nmorals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. If you value monogamous\nrelationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel\nlike you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not\nhappy when they do that. However, if monogamy is not something you value, then\nperhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still\nright for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships, and that\nis alright. Finally,if you value your husbands feelings and know that the\naffairs would hurt him, then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your\nown values. That can only be determined by you. \n2.Based on how you describe your relationship, it\nsounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. From the outside, it looks like the affairs\nare a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument. This\nis something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a\nrelationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about\nhow our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the\nquestion to ask here is, when you look out toward the future with your husband,\nis this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex,\nargument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. \n3.What are your goals for this relationship? If we\nstart to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things on\nautopilot. Get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. None\nof which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and\ndreams you once had for this relationship?\n4.\nHave you considered seeking marital counseling? Not\nhaving affairs will not actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading\nyou to have them. If there is something broken, it sometimes requires some help\nto get it fixed. \nHopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to\nsome kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship. I certainly\nwish you well. \nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC END"}
{"prompt":"My stepdad and I always mess around. I have noticed that whenever he playfully hits me, it is always my butt that he hits. He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room. I am a teenager female, and I want to know if this is normal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter. As far as scanning you from head to toe, I can think of reasons that parents might do that. I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are. That way, it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are. END"}
{"prompt":"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I work with many couples that experience a wide range of sexual and relationship challenges. The one aspect I tell many folks that I work with, is this: Every person and relationship is different. There really is not a \"normal\" amount of sex a person should have or want to have. If having sex 4 to 5 times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If you or your husband would like to have sex more often, I suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied. The aspect of connectedness is an important one. While sex can be very connecting for many couples, it is not the only way to connect. I find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex, checking in to see how you and your husband feel, as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to fulfilling this need.

{"prompt":"I am always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me.    How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Have the two of you ever discussed how you feel? I know given the nature of your question that is probably not likely, but I am going to suggest it any way. He needs to understand that how you feel about this issue equates to not being as happy in the relationship as you could be or he thinks you are. So start there, that may be more of an attention getter than \"you never listen to me\" yes I do etc. Direct opener: I am not as happy in this relationship as I think we both deserve. Pause, and if you will not let me talk about it then it is only going to get worse. Then explain you do not feel listened to, you try to be a good listener but you do not feel you are getting the same in return. If he interrupts put your hand up in the sign of a stop, then say please just let me finish. You are right to raise this subject with him because a good marriage cannot exist in a communication vacuum. In fairness to him, he needs to understand the seriousness of your concern and have a chance to do better. If he refuses, tell him you want to seek couples counseling then do it, with him or without him. END"}
{"prompt":"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I am a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I am beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I have been happily married for almost 35 years.\n   I have never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I think this is a very common question that people who have never been to counseling before have. There is a lot of anxiety in going to counseling for the first time. This is normal. In answer to your question, the answer is an absolute NO! An important thing to remember about getting counseling is that it is a courageous first step towards hope and healing. Getting help is like training to run a marathon, it is not a sprint. You have shared a lot of issues that you are dealing with from your past, that are now negatively impacting your present, but I believe that in getting the right kind of help and support, none of them are impossible to overcome. Part of the therapeutic process is defining and prioritizing therapy goals. In collaboration with you, as a client, a therapist is there to help you with this process in determining what you would like to work on first. Not getting counseling, based on the history you have shared, has the potential to put you more at risk for mental and physical health issues. You are already seeing this happen as you begin to experience new symptoms, namely your anxiety. In therapy, you will gain understanding and insight, as well as learn skills and strategies to manage the symptoms you are experiencing.In conclusion, I would encourage you to reach out to a licensed counselor who has experience in treating trauma, grief\/loss and will address shame. These are three areas that I have found that gets to the core issues that are contributing to your depression and anxiety.  I believe you can get the help you need to find hope and healing. Best of luck to you! END"}
{"prompt":"I was never like this. Recently this year (my first year of high school), I started getting emotional for no reason.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello Vancouver, It is really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes. The small thing is a \"trigger\", and the emotions are not so much about that event that is happening in the present; they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling. You have likely had too much of that feeling in your life and you have developed a sensitivity to it. Look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke. If there is anger there, look underneath that. Is it powerlessness, worthlessness, hurt, shame...? Then ask yourself when in your life you have experienced TOO much of that feeling. As a child, maybe, but not necessarily.That is the first step, and combined with empathy, compassion and self-esteem, you are starting to build what I call an emotional air conditioner. A good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily. I wish you the best. END"}

I have been married for just three months. Every week we discuss something and seem worse and worse. At the beginning of marriage, we hope to live an eternal honeymoon, but the reality is different.

Learn to solve discussions with clear decisions and remembering that if they care about each other, and that is why they decided to be together in the first place. They discuss their roles and expectations, regularly this is done during matrimonial preparation classes, but it is never too late to talk about what they would like their marriage and what they expect from their partner, thus clarify the roles and rules that will apply to their union. They find a marriage counselor that helps them to mediate communication problems and help them learn to learn assertive communication skills and conflict resolution. END"}
{"prompt":"After 25 years, I fell in love for the first time. The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye. My heart is burning, and I cannot take this pain.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ouch. Losing someone you love hurts so much. We all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful. While it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances, I would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life. When we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family. While no one is going to be able to make it better, we do not have to be alone with our pain. If you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for.

{"prompt":"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I am a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I am beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I have been happily married for almost 35 years.\n   I have never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" No, there are never too many issues to address in counseling. Therapy would begin by prioritizing what you feel needs to be addressed first. As one area improves, such as processing history of abuse you are likely to see improvement in other areas of your life...like sleeping better. END"}
{"prompt":"I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like  they just want nothing to do with me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you, wish you were different or someone else, and ultimately reject you. One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.

{"prompt":"My long-term girlfriend broke up with me recently. She says it is because of my anger.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I need help controlling my anger.Anger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues. Anger also helps us understand that there is something wrong that needs to change. Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry, then we can explore the source of anger.Ask yourself: Why am angry, Am I hurt, disappointed, confused, embarrassed etc.? Once you find the answer, explore how often that happens and what is your reaction. Then explore how else you could respond or react. You could use I-statements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario. This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration, especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso, it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggressionand learn to manage our anger before we act on it. Anger is a feeling; aggression is when you act out your anger physically, verbally and psychologically. Find ways to vent: crying or sweating will help to release your anger, and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry. Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotions.Necesito ayuda para controlar mi coraje.El coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos. El coraje tambin nos ayudo a entender que hay algo mal que debemos cambiar. Cuando entendemos que algo mas causo el coraje entonces podemos explorar la fuente.Pregntate a ti mismo: Por qu tengo coraje, estoy herido, decepcionado, confundido, avergonzado, etc.? Ya que encuentres la respuesta, explora cuan frecuente tienes esa reaccin. Luego explora como puedes reaccionar en otra ocasin. Puedes usar expresiones del Yo para comunicar tus verdaderos sentimientos a la persona envuelta en la situacin. Esto es un buen ejercicio para practicar con tu Consejero o profesional de la salud mental ya que otros conflictos sin resolver pueden surgir durante este proceso de exploracin.Tambin es importante entender la diferencia entre el coraje y la agresin, y aprender a manejar el coraje antes que actuemos. El coraje es un sentimiento y la agresin es cuando expresas tu coraje agrediendo a alguien, fsica, emocional o sicolgicamente. Encuentra maneras de desagotare, llorar o sudar te pueden ayudar en este proceso al balancear la respuesta qumica que crea el cuerpo cuando estamos molestos.

{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi there,There are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including, but not limited to the client reaching their goals, the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship. The last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed. All of these things could happen, and usually happen organically (again, except for the last example).Your question, however, was about the counselor ending treatment. This is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. It may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. It is important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. Do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?In regular, open-ended sessions, I try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. In these check-ins, I use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. I also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. In goal-oriented sessions, I check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and I remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal.Often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. This is actually a great place to go with them; why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? Often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. That said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up.In the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. It is a difficult conversation, but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed.I hope that this brief response can assist you going forward! END"}
{"prompt":"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It is gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I am always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I have went without sleep is three days.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That is awful! I am sure you are ready to start getting some rest. It is normal for us to wake a few times in the night, however, when we are dealing with high anxiety or stress, those times can turn into being up most night. Given that you are having these repeated dreams, I am wondering what might be going on in your life either now or in the past that could be triggering stress or maybe memories. It can help to draw the dream out in the morning or even to look for metaphor. In the long run, seeking counseling can help you sort all that outIn the meantime, self-soothing strategies may help you in the night when you wake and cannot get back to sleep. This can be anything with your senses----getting a snack like tea and focusing on that taste, smelling something pleasant, listening to some relaxing music, looking through a magazine, taking a shower. Anything you can think of that might help you relax. If it involves needing to get up, that is okay! Getting out of bed can actually help you get out of that mind space and helps you associate your bed with relaxation\/sleep vs anxiety making it more likely you will fall asleep once you lay down.

My gut is to start with your family physician, because you have some physical symptoms.

{"prompt":"I feel insecure in my life. I do not think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does. I have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues. I have had a drinking problem for a few years. I feel the reason I drink is not just because I like to, but because I have lately been on edge. I have been very oddly emotional when watching movies that I have been watching for years. I am paranoid about driving on main roads. I am very jumpy at the slightest noises.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Given the description you have posted here, it may be time to find someone to work with. First and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking. This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research. There are however, ways to address this. As for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model (DBT) which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation. Mindfulness, another component of DBT should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence. There are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships. Well worth looking into.Seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist. This is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away. Think of it this way, if you broke your arm, would you just wrap it up and hope for the best? or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound. The same applies here. Think of it as first aid for the mind. END"}

{"prompt":"A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection,    Now I am In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. This is causing major problems for my ego and it is diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage.    I am devastated and cannot find a because for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to.    What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you have not already, please see a doctor. ED can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out.Once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an erection, it is time to look for more subtle causes. Unfortunately, you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of \"I hope I can, but what if I cannot?\" which is certain to interfere with performance.Again, rule out physical causes (can you tell I think that is important?), then talk with your wife about working together to find the right approach. It might be a good idea, for example, to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse. You can have great sex without penetration and you can have physical intimacy without sex, so slow down and experiment. You might find more pleasure than you expect when you can relax knowing there does not have to be a \"finish line\".Again, yes the third time, SEE A DOCTOR, just in case there is something going on.

{"prompt":"How does a person start the counseling process?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Great question! You can find a counselor by doing an internet search or by asking your doctor for a referral. Once you have the name and contact information for a therapist you want to meet with, give them a call. Some therapists will provide a free 15-20 minute phone consultation. This is a good chance for you to get some questions asked. Be sure to ask about their fee, if you want to use your insurance ask them if they take your insurance. Next you will want to ask about availability to make sure they have open times that fit in your schedule. Once you make the appointment, in the first session you have with the therapist, the therapist will ask a lot of questions about what brought you into therapy and what you hope to accomplish in therapy. I usually use the last 10 minutes of that first session talking with clients about how I might be able to help them with their concern and I gather feedback from them. Here is a link to an article about how to speak with your therapist in those first couple of sessions.http:\/\/thriveworks.com\/blog\/tips-open-honest-counselor\/ END"}
{"prompt":"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful.  Now he is depressed and hopeless again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I do not mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization,to getfollow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You cannot remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he does not want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is alwaysagood option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC  END"}
{"prompt":"It happens especially at me and my sister, and then she gets emotional and brings up the past. How should I deal with it? She is always stressed about her work and does not put her family first.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Anger is a normal emotion, and yet it is a really hard one... how much is too much? and how do you express it without damaging those around you? yes mom's get angry, sometimes too easy... but its their responsibility to manage their anger-- get their own support and put themselves in time outs when they cannot handle it well. Since you are the kids, you should not have to fix or calm down mom's anger. Maybe in a calmer time when you guys are being silly talk with her one on one? Tell her you are feeling sad and hurt that she gets upset at you girls. Ask her if there is 1 thing you can work on this next month to help her. Ask her if she would work on 1 thing for you this month-- not yelling? taking a time out? telling you before she blows her top so you can exit the room? Also for you, check out a library book on anger so you know how to handle yours, and one on parents and anger. Number one to remember, if you do not feel safe, if she is calling you names, or hurting you, breaking things etc. make sure you go to a trusted adult--school counselor, neighbor, aunt, church friend as soon as possible.

I feel like even if I did forgive her, I would not be able to say it to her face.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you are not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You are on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you have reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!

{"prompt":"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably is not her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yes, certainly your mom's difficulty in having meaningful conversations with people results from the Alzheimer's disease process which weakens her brain function.Feeling a sense of guilt in relation to a parent, is pretty common for everyone.This is because as little kids and babies, we had a strong reliance on a parent and believing every word they sad and wishing to follow each action they ask or demand, was for the benefit of our own survival.One way of coping with your feeling of guilt is to examine it.Ask what it is you are feeling guilty about?Chances are that your sense of guilt is less due to what you are currently saying or doing to help your mom.Very likely, your guilt feeling is awakening the sense of obligation that you and all of us feel toward a parent simply because parents seem to have unquestionable power when we are very young.After all, you are thoughtful enough to write a question, so chances are great that you are already actively involved in caring for your mom.

Some people seem to really provoke emotional responses in us. One thing to learn for a quick review of yourself when you are provoked is to pay attention to your body.Notice your heart rate, fists clenched, some warmth going through your body and these are signs that the interaction is toxic for you. Move out of the room, say something calling to both of you and let things simmer down before responding.When you are able to calm your body, think of ways to bring the issue to her attention using positive words but holding your ground. If she does not listen ask someone to come with you to talk to her about it, If she still will not listen, reassess your expectations of her.Finally if you need to , you may have to consider changing the status of your rooming together.

Can you help me please?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it. You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization. A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way. Until you realize there is a problem you will not start looking for a solution.Do not misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed.First, go and buy the book Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him I do not need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and do not come back until you are ready to make some changes. She stuck to that, too. He did not leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end.You cannot let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone cannot do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life.These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still do not know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You cannot change your partner. Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become. END"}

What you are experiencing is common for people who have experienced abuse, neglect, or other forms of trauma.

{"prompt":"I start counseling\/therapy in a few days (I am freaking out) but my main fear is that I will cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi there ! As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years , I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another. Starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe , you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before. I have seen people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard.  I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving. I can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry and there is nothing to be embarrassed about.  Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down.  Crying is often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .So , to summarize , do not worry at all about crying!

{"prompt":"My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. The next day, she kicked me out.  She let me move back two days later. Yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind. I asked if the other guy was a factor, but she says it is not my business.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When \"threats\" of leaving, such as what you described in your question (\"kicking you out, wanting divorce\") are continuous in your marriage, it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship, impacting both partners. And, if you are concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship, and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife, it is extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship.From the information provided in your question, it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship. Avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship. If your wife is willing, I would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time. Or, for you to talk with an individual therapist, if marriage counseling is not an option.

{"prompt":"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she did not have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First of all, where did you find the pills? Did you have to go into her private space or things to find them? If so, you might want to do some research on codependency. I recommend the book \"The Everything Guide to Codependency.\" You can find it here:https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/The-Everything-Guide-Codependency-codependent\/dp\/1440573905 . It is not honest to go searching through someone is things. You dislike the deceit in her, so why model it in yourself?If the pills were just left out, that is a different story. Again though, model honesty. Talk to about what you found. Avoid being accusitory. A good old \"I found these...what is going on with this?\" might be a good place to start. Tell her how it makes you feel. Have you ever heard of \"I statements?\" Google this....you will find a lot of good templates on how to frame this conversation.At the end of the day though, these are her choices. Not yours. All you can do is tell her how you feel, make a few gentle suggestions, and get back to taking care of you. If it gets to the point where seeing her downward spiral is too much for you, let her know this and tell her you can no longer be involved, for the sake of your own health and sanity.There is nothing wrong with trying to help, but ask yourself, are you really being helpful? If you are starting to feel resentful, know that you have crossed the line into codependency and back away.Hope this helps and all the best,Aleisha END"}
{"prompt":"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I am doing things she finds disrespectful even when I do not mean it like that.

How do I get her to understand?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You may not get her to understand your point of view with any more success than your wife is having with you to do the same.It is possible you are a balanced couple in the sense of neither one of you understanding the other.The deeper question to ponder is whether each of you can accept the other person even though you each have very different terms for defining \"cheating\".You will find either there are enough strong similarities to keep the two of you happy as a couple, or there are not these similarities.Then, the new question would be whether either of you want to address your findings or not.

{"prompt":"I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. I am not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and does not keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.\nI feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I do not know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In a way, yes, you have separation anxiety. It is normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection. So, just because your boyfriend is not talking as much or keeping you up-to-date does not necessarily mean what you fear it means...that he is forgotten about you or loves you less. It could mean quite the opposite...that he is focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you. He may think he is loving you more, but you feel loved less. You have two jobs to do here. The first is to manage your anxiety by \"talking back\" to the thoughts it puts into your head. It sounds like \"It is normal to be insecure, but I have tons of evidence that he loves me and that I mean the world to him...\" Find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim. The second part of your job is to let him know what you need. You need more affection and connection during this period when he is away (more texts, phone calls, information). It is okay to want that, and I am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when he is away. END"}
{"prompt":"Does counseling really do anything that can help people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I believe that counseling (and finding a GOOD therapist)\nwill be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change,\nimprovement, and overall growth. Most counseling involves homework and a level\nof commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of\nproblems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way. Here are\nsome of the key ways that therapy can help. \n1. Helps to define the problem and gain a clearer\nunderstanding of where it originates. Many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are\nexperiencing. These can include feeling sad, increased sleeping, substance use,\npanic attacks, self-harm, isolating ones self, academic decline, etc. Often\ntimes, people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms. Having a\ntherapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where\nthey come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their\nproblems. \n2. Allows for a safe outlet to vent.\nNot everyone likes to share their problems with close\nfriends or family members. Maybe they do not want others to know of their flaws.\nMaybe they do not want to burden others with their problems. Or maybe they just\nare not comfortable talking about themselves. And in some situations people do\nnot have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no\nfriends or family. While talking with those we know can help bring some relief\nit is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and\nemotionally removed from given situations. Counseling gives a safe outlet in\nwhich one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling\njudged.\n3. Counselors can offer various problem solving solutions.\n\nA good therapist usually will not directly point their\nclient in the direction they need to go. Counseling is about growth and\nteaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies\nthat will bring about emotional and psychological relief. Counselors will help\nclients to explore the various options available in given situation, based on\nthe clients needs, wants, and values and will help them to choose the option\nthat best fits with their desired outcome. \n4. Gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future\nproblems.\nMany individuals that seek therapy have never learned\ngood coping strategies. Perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to\nmodel productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are\noverbearing and take away the energy needed to cope. Different diagnoses\nrequire different tools; however some are beneficial for any problem and any\nindividual. These include but are not limited to relaxation techniques,\nbreathing exercises, development of healthy routines, using mindfulness,\nimproving communication skills, and recognizing and changing maladaptive\nthought patterns. A good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools,\nwill often practice them during session, and will assign homework for further\npractice and mastery of the skills. END"}

I have never really known who I am.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is perhaps the deepest question that one can ask of themselves and the answer is as elusive as the deepest enigma. We are fluid beings, we are never the same from day to day, we learn or unlearn, we evolve or some of us even devolve, we are in a state of constant flux, changing and adapting, like a cloud in the sky that has its shape changed by the wind, life whittles us away and carves us constantly, trying to understand this question is like trying to bite your own teeth, however we can have a sense of what we would call our core and to understand the core, we need to live and to experience, but also to think deeply, analytically, and critically, by engaging with life we get a sense that we are like the Earth itself, inside of us there is a core, just as there is inside our planet but our continents shift and change over time, like those continents so does our own nature shift throughout our lives.

{"prompt":"I recently lost a friend to suicide. I am smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First of all, I am very sorry for your loss, and I can understand the urge to drink and smoke to try and cope. As I am sure you understand, alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run, but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend. Grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult, confusing, and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process. It also may be useful for you to add other ways of coping, such as taking care of yourself through exercise, doing healthy activities that you love, and spending time with people that you love. Self care is often most difficult when we need it the most. Thank you for reaching out. END"}
{"prompt":"He said he would try and he never did. It is been nine months, and this is making me worse. Today, he said I have to respect whatever decision he makes. Is that true? Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cannot handle what I am going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night? He is constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wow that is tough. There is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression. It sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. I would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you have not already. While depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy. With that being said - if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end, then I cannot see what choice you have but to \"respect his decision\" as you mentioned. This does not mean that you have to feel okay with the decision - as I am sure you would not - but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make. If he is wanting to leave - this could make things a lot tougher for you. I would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family. You do not need to face depression alone - nor should you have to. We all need support at tough times like these. END"}
{"prompt":"I have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky.  Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello. First, I am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings. They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional,your continued dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This isYOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential because and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and areincredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases. Wishing you the very best!Laura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC END"}
{"prompt":"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I do not like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he cannot live without it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be \"normal\" in the bedroom, I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! It DOES NOT necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you.That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on is not always what we identify as. Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly do not consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else. It could be that your husband enjoys pretending\/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc. Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it is the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at \"the mercy\" of someone else once a week).Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and do not like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being \"normal.\" It is also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon & Simon, 1973).You have been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment.ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It is like our own sex fingerprint.In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ. If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives.Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple's sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another's - needs, desires, and wishes while making sure his\/her own needs are being met.If \"pegging\" your husband as it is called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script. However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about \"needing\" to dress in a female fashion and\/or be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that does not hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!

{"prompt":"I am obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder.  How do I move on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Initially, everything is a reminder because there is a trace of that other person present in everything in your life.When we lose someone, we are saying goodbye to what we thought our future was going to be. Accepting that is changed and allowing ourselves to envision a new future is necessary to \"move on\".Start learning something new or try a new activity that you have always wanted to do. Find whatever is \"good\" about being out of the relationship and focus on those things. This can be an exciting time of transformation for you.  As time goes by, you will add new things in your life that are not entwined with this relationship and those things will begin to crowd out those things associated with the relationship. Give yourself a little empathy, no one goes through a breakup without being sad. It is ok to be sad. It is even ok to feel devastated. Loss of a relationship touches a primal need we have to belong. It makes us feel insecure, unanchored. In truth, we are ok, safe even. This experience will open different perspectives for you. There are lessons you will take from it that will add another facet to you as a person. Maybe in time, you will even appreciate this experience. I am sorry you are hurting right now.

{"prompt":"I am a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I have become a very angry drunk.    In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol.    But now, even if I do not do anything wrong and do not embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I do not understand why I am feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello, I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like you are concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an \"addict\" or \"alcoholic.\" You might have a \"problem\" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.I do not have information to know if \"addiction\" or \"dependence\" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it is begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I am writing here is very general and does not address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you are avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support.Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that is your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you do not drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger.I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness. END"}
{"prompt":"I have been with my partner for 4 years. She is given me no reason not to trust her. But lately I have been overreacting a lot when she is just doing normal things. I think it is triggering my bad past relationships.\n\nHow can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What is most important is that you recognize that what you have been doing is off base - that what you have been feeling is \"overreacting,\" that you have \"insecurities,\" and you suspect your actions and reactions are connected to your own past and not to the current situation or to your partner. That is an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself, it is unlikely that you would change.That said, you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth... not because there is something \"wrong\" with you, but because you are ready to learn more about yourself and make some creative changes in your behavior. Yes, there are lots of self-help books and courses, but we humans often make the most progress when we have support inreal-timefrom another human being who can sit with us, point out our blind spots, and teach us some skills that are hard to learn on our own.

Everyone says they are here for me but it does not feel like they are. Why do I feel so alone?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Although we can have moments when we feel alone, even with the presence of family and friends, feeling alone most of the time could be a sign that there is a lack of connection between you and your loved ones. Generally, the lack of connection can occur when you do not feel heard, understood or valued. These are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of loneliness.You mentioned that \"they listen but do not understand.\" Do you communication clearly about what you need emotionally (understood, accepted, valued, heard, empathized)? To help you ask for the right type of support, you can ask yourself what it is about the situation that is bothering you and how you would wish for your friends and family to respond to you. The result may be an answer that is more informative to your loved ones. For example, you might say, \"Thank you for listening to me. When I feel alone, I feel like nobody cares about me because everybody seems busy with their lives. I just wanted to hear and feel that I am valued by receiving caring messages and phone calls.\"Dr. Virginia Chowwww.psychologyresource.ca END"}

{"prompt":"I recently lost a friend to suicide.  I am smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am so sorry to hear about your recent loss. There is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss, and it is never easy. I think it is important to remember that there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to deal with loss and the \"best way\" for you may not be the best way for someone else. The fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more, and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques, is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time. Marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions, but they do not really help us to work through those emotions.When it comes to grief, often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports; talk to your friends and family, see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty. The more we talk about our feelings, the more we are okay with them being ours. The more we express our loss, the better we become at accepting such a loss. In talking with your supports, you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend; ways you can do so on a personal level (writing a poem, planting a tree, etc.) or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them (a special day where you get together to share your memories, starting a charity, etc.)We never truly \"get over\" our losses, but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us now...but that also takes time.

She is trying to control my life. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you cannot change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions. You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack. There are ways you can deal with controlling parents  and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you will calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they are trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you are losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There are not any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.  Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.

{"prompt":"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It could be really helpful to see a counselor\/therapist about your increasing depression\/panic symptoms. Finding out the because of depression\/anxiety is not always as straightforward as it seems, since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific trigger\/reason. For example, if I am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life, then I start seeing life through this lens of feeling down, and typically I will start to see a lot more that I get down about, and it can really build very quickly on itself. Same with anxiety. Obviously, this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained, but that is where working with a counselor\/therapist comes in.I would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic, and if you can (through the panic attack) continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations. Even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations you are feeling - such as saying to yourself \"Okay, I am breathing really rapidly, and my heart is racing, now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight...\" Reminding yourself that it is just your body's reaction to stress, and while it might be overreacting right now, you are okay and eventually it will go away. I highly recommend the SAM for Anxiety Management app for the anxiety piece, and I would not be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too. END"}

You do not say how old he is, so I am not sure whether the problem is deeper, but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step. Pushing him at this point could worsen the problem, so I suggest pulling back the expectations, waiting a month or two, looking for more signs of readiness and trying again. In general, teaching children to use the toilet works best when \"mistakes\" are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively. END"}

{"prompt":"I feel too scared to meet people I do not know - even relatives. I do not ever raise my hand or talk in school. I feel like no one understands. How can I handle this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Congratulations on your courage to ask this question!This shows you are willing to engage with other people, just not in all situations, especially the in person ones.Start by \"meeting\" yourself.Reflect as thoroughly as possible as to what you imagine will be the outcome of meeting others or of speaking up during a class.Some people are afraid of being criticized or judged by other people, or do this to themselves inwardly. If you are judging or criticizing yourself to be less worthy of having opinions or views or of being who you are, than others, then the thought of actually placing yourself in this situation, would feel intolerable.One way to move out from this position of feeling less than others, is to recognize that these feelings are inside of you.Then it is possible to know at least on an intellectual level that it is not true that any one person is superior to another.All the people whom you are afraid to meet, also have their own insecurities.We are all equal in worth and in having blindspots about ourselves.Also, it is possible that you are naturally shy and may be expecting more from yourself than is reasonable, in terms of a standard about meeting others.You may have a few fears of being judged unfairly, you may also simply not enjoy being around people very much.Be aware to not push yourself beyond your natural limits. Overcoming fears of being judged is different than forcing yourself to do what is against your basic nature. END"}
{"prompt":"How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello. The end of the counselor\/client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement. Counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons. Among them are the client's inability to make forward progress in therapy; the clinician's inability to help the client (for a variety of reasons); a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided; or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere. In this last case, a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client's inability to pay. That is traditionally seen as an unethical practice. Other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client, which in itself should be paramount.When the client and therapist decide that services are done, it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur, and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client (and vicariously to the clinician as well, those this is perhaps not as important). This transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey...rather than some abrupt departure from it. (An abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). Sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed, in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. In this case, the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy, to a place of healing, growth and situational resolution.I have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will), that I learned years ago during graduate school: \"Not every therapist is good for every client, and not every client is good for every therapist.\" It is perhaps one of the most important guiding views I hold in working with clients. The therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life, and the therapist's desire to truly see the client heal and grow. When there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring, the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. Or, if already formed, may at some point be unable to move forward. In these instances, referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. Usually, this can be seen pretty quickly by either party, though sometimes it is not always clear.Ultimately, the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor, or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. If both are observant in this process, they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. Eventually, therapy will end, but hopefully based on the client's successful journey to the place where they wanted to go, and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter.

{"prompt":"Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city.

I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed.    I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings\/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship.    What can I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It sounds like you are feeling pretty criticized by your cousin and at the same time you are wondering whether or not there is some truth in what she is saying. It also sounds like you would like to see if you can find a new way to relate to your cousin, so that your relationship can be more satisfying.

{"prompt":"I self-harm, and I stop for awhile. Then when I see something sad or depressing, I automatically want to self-harm.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In a way, self-harm can present somewhat like an addiction. According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior.  Someone who is trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy and\/or Interpersonal Neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you. END"}

I do not feel happy with the decisions I make, which makes me unhappy with others. I feel like a failure most of the time. I feel that I am not good at all. I feel that I am less than the others. At the same time you are experiencing symptoms of depression, which can be caused by recent changes in your life or be accumulating over time. The important thing at this time is that you recognize the symptoms and you are looking to change the situation. The first step would be to work to restore a personal care routine that helps you feel emotionally stable and motivated: go for a walk or do some physical activity (have compassion with yourself, anything works to start), start eating balanced, especially grains and integral fibers,, try to rest at night and avoid naps, and practice some kind of activity that you enjoyed in the past or that you have curious. You mentioned that your spirit is uneasy, explore your spirituality, and that it would help you find peace, seek way to do that practice a routine. If you cost you a lot. It is common to have thoughts that threaten your life or that of others, discuss them with your therapist, with your primary or psychiatrist doctor, and call 9-1-1 if it is an emergency. Since you get stability, you can start working or explore the because of the problem and see if there are greater changes that you should do or skills that you must learn to handle the same. It is also a good time to explore your spirituality more deeply and your purpose in life, when we find a purpose and how to exercise it, we tend to be happier with ourselves and with others. END"}
{"prompt":"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I was not acting like myself. I was quiet, which I am usually not. I did not talk to anybody and did not have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We are all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we are at our best when we are all helping each other. I am glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes.I can tell that you are smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you \"not being yourself\", and then how you felt when your grandma died.When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you did not seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they did not know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that is how it works.When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people would not like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we do not show ourselves, people cannot see who we are; they do not know us as well and then they do not know what we need and they cannot care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us.So, where you are at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people could not see your pain and know that you needed support.There is a simple solution, but you would have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say \"Get off my back!\". \"You are not helping me by telling me lies.\" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they will be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this! END"}

I moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Grief is unpredictable and does not fit into rules and stereotypes. Everybody grieves differently, react in their own ways. There can be no expectations about how long, how hard, how easy it will be.Furthermore there is no way around it. No matter how much we may want to escape the pain and accelerate the process by doing all the 'right' things we have been told will help with our bereavement, there is only one way: through...The more we allow the pain to go through us, experience it, accept it, acknowledge it, make peace with it, the more we will heal.Grief comes in waves but can also feel like a rollercoaster. At first the waves feel like tsunamis, with time they become smaller and more spaced out. Yet every time they catch us by surprise. All the 'firsts without them' after a loved one has passed away, every anniversary, birthday, holiday, are all difficult times.You can not force grief to go away, to heal the wound faster than it needs to take. What you can do though is ride the wave. Go with the flow. Accept the pain. Express it. Talk to your loved one that has passed away. Express your emotions, every single one of them, both positive and negative. Write down in your journal. Take good care of your body, your nutrition, your rest. Grief is very taxing on the body too yet we disregard that.Read inspiring books, surround yourself with beauty and things that soothe your soul. Be brave and be open to the world out there, be vulnerable with pride. Try new things you never dared try before. Meet new people. Travel. Hang out with close friends. Ask for help when you need it. Be kind and gentle to yourself.The more you chase and wait for happiness, the more it will elude you. The more you stay bravely in your present and do the best you can, being loving to yourself, honest about your feelings and do not try to escape grief, the sooner it will loosen up it is claws and allow you to feel relief and finally heal.One thing is for certain, happiness will be there to it is appointment and it will be when you least expect it!Keep the faith and keep walking, nothing can remain the same forever. The only certainty is change! END"}

I have been talking to a guy friend, and I feel more loved by him than my boyfriend.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Michigan, Relationships are so sparkly for a few years, and then things start to feel different. Most of the time, this is simply because we have pulled back from all the attachment-forming behaviours we did at the beginning. We stop talking a lot, because we have less to discover...we do less for each other and buy fewer gifts...spend less time together...all because we have already formed the love and attachment and we do not need to \"fill the gas tank\" as much. So, just because it feels different does not mean it is \"gone bad\".Having said that, it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need; you do not feel loved enough right now. Can you tell him? Have you told him? The strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are. Let him know what you need, and see if he gets it.You have choices to make and there is no wrong choice. You certainly have the right to say \"this is not feeling great anymore\", or \"I want to explore other relationships\", and walk away. But often it is worth it to see how good something can be before you bail.You are drawn to someone else, and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship. Your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new. Your boyfriend cannot compete with that if he does not know you are unhappy.For some people, being drawn to someone else is a sign they are not into their partner. For others, it is a danger alert, and it makes them want to improve their current relationship. Which one are you? END"}
{"prompt":"My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. She then started to act younger than she is. \n\nNow she only wants to play with younger kids and she does not act her age. I do not know why this is happening. Is this normal?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hello.It sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior .  It is really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on . You are clearly an observant and hands on mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is ok.This is a tough question to answer without more information . With that said , I have found that \"under stress people regress.\" In other words , many people , children and adults alike , often regress and behave differently - as if they were younger than their actual age - when under stress .  Therefore , my first question would be : has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress ? This could be anything from conflict at home , recent changes such as moving , divorce , a loss of some kind , switching schools , or losing a friend or friends .  Additionally , sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers , they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence .  I would suggest that you think about what stressors \/ changes may have occurred recently. You may also want to check in with her teacher (s) to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughter's behavior at school .I also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her. Something as simple as \" I have noticed that you are not spending time with the friends you used to hang out with ; it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately . Am I right about that ? \" and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as : \"did something happen with your friends that is making you not want to be with them?\" \"Has something been bothering you lately ? Are you feeling upset or worried ? \"If she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say \" I know that sometimes when I feel stressed or worried , I tend to act a little differently - sometimes I withdraw from my regular group of friends , or I get cranky and feel less like myself . I wonder if something like that is happening with you ?\"If you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and \/ or her teachers , perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times , or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively . The more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter , including any changes or new stressors , any possible patterns to this behavior , if school has become more difficult socially and or academically , the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her.Good luck!  I believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of children's behavior. I do, though, think that you will feel more assured about this if you can get to the bottom of what is going on .  END"}

Sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame. The most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality. \"I do not feel worth anything, but I know what I do is important, I know who I am matters to others.

I am very hurt and confused.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of \"hurt and confused\"?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics. Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations do not go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.

Traumatic experiences can become embedded in our bodies, as well as in our emotions.

{"prompt":"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I am afraid it is going to break her. I do not know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I hear your concern that your daughter might break under the pressure and stress that she is dealing with. It is a good thing that your high achieving daughter is calling out for help and that you are listening. The education system is wrought with social and emotional problems, and there is a disproportionate emphasis on test taking, scores and achievement in school. It sounds like your daughter would benefit from some social and emotional education and learning to understand how her feelings are impacting her thoughts and behaviors.I would like to also assure you that crying and freaking out is a normal part of growing up. Depending on your daughter's age, it is likely that she is going through a growth spurt and she may be feeling her feelings in a unique way to her too. If this is the first time you are having a concern about anxiety then rest at ease and see if you can ride the emotions with her and be a stable sounding board for her. Use empathy and compassion and allow her a safe place to process through her concerns. Try not to solve it for her, but allow her a space to fumble through and find her own answers to the problems she is faced with. Give her confidence that she can figure it out, and be patient as you sit with her. Our presence is key to our children's well being. Make eye contact with her, allow her to squirm and get frustrated and work through it while you witness her process. As parents, when we can model calm in the storm of life our children learn that all of their feelings are ok too. When our children see and feel our fear, it can create more insecurity and low self evaluation of their own efficacy to manage the stress. When we can be calm and reassuring, then we can boost their confidence in their own ability to problem solve what they are going through. Let us face it we all have irrational thinking from time to time, and usually it is when we are under stress.If your daughter continues to show concerning anxiety, check with her school and see if she can benefit from an opportunity with the social emotional learning curriculum. In Texas at least, schools are required to have resources for children like your daughter who are experiencing anxiety and other mental health concerns. Her teacher is with her all day and you may request to have a conference with her to see if she can help her in any way as well. If resources in your school are limited then I would seek an outside therapist who specializes in working with children your daughter's age. Call around and see if she can benefit from a therapeutic relationship outside of school and home. Once you have plenty of feedback from her teacher and a therapist or counselor then you will be able to determine if seeking medical care is necessary with their support and guidance. Thank you for your courage to reach out for help on behalf of your daughter. You are her greatest advocate. I hope that you find support to help you navigate this time in her life and that you both grow and learn from this experience. END"}

I have tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Enid, You sound like a sensitive parent; I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. There is some key information here (I do not know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he is stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I will give you my thoughts.I see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. \"What can I get away with?\" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they are much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It is a normal behaviour, and most of the time it is about small things that do not matter and we do not even find out.Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I am not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it is okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It is appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child does not do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea.It is funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they will get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we do not want people to know our mistakes). It is a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you will not give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth.You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You are making honesty fun. Kids love games.Basically, there is as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative.If this is the first serious offence for your son, do not make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it is a pattern, that is different and you may want the input of a therapist. END"}

Even though I know this disease is not her fault, I am still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes, and seems\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Good observation on your part, to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward you.Has your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to you?If prior to the onset of Alzheimer's, she never examined her way of relating to you, and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you, then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogue.She may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because she is been stuck in this attitude for most of your life.The good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom, has very little to do with the way she relates to you.This is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimer's began.You can however, feel a little more free knowing that you are not deserving of being ignored.

{"prompt":"I was the one who ended it, and I am so glad I did. It was the best decision I made in my life. But how do I stop the nightmares and flashbacks? It is creating a wall in my current relationship.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now. If you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice, that may help to center you. Tried to stay grounded and\/or mindful. That is being aware of your position in the room, your feet on the floor, your hands in your lap, or your hips in the chair. Being mindful of the environment you are currently (for example, noticing what is around you) may be helpful. Try to use all your senses. For example, you could focus on hearing your husband's voice, feeling his hand in yours, being wrapped in your favorite blanket, seeing a comforting photo, using a comforting sense or candle, or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchen.It also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma. I would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professional.Remember, just because it was the best decision of your life, that does not mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship. Our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again. This is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all. END"}
{"prompt":"I recently broke up with my boyfriend After being together for over 4 years. I truly believe I did the right thing, but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself.\n    I am seeing someone casually and I am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation.\n   How can I learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career, relationship status, etc?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Possibly you have not completed your phase of mourning the recently passed relationship and lifestyle which surrounded it.Relationship breakups mean a person's entire life goes through an adjustment since the relationship impacted all areas of your life.Give yourself some patience to restore yourself from the old relationship.When you feel whole again then more than likely you will lose some of the anxiety wondering what your new casual partner feels about you.And instead of wondering, you may simply decide to ask the person your question!

{"prompt":"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I am afraid it is going to break her. I do not know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sometimes stress helps us become motivated and thrive to do better however, if your daughter is stressing to the point that she is crying and freaking out then that would be concerning. Helping your daughter with relaxation techniques like deep breathing or guided imagery would be a good start. Also, reminding your daughter that you see her doing so well in school and that most importantly you are there for her. I would also make an appointment to see a mental health therapist they can have more ideas on ways to de-stress. END"}
{"prompt":"I have not had a friend since I was 19. I do not go anywhere, and I have no job, all because I am afraid of people.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Individual and\/or group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety. Often in therapy, the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety, in a sensitive way, and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want. In group therapy, you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist, but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I cannot be happy without him.\n   How do I get away from this relationship?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful. Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree. People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly \"be alone\", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you. END"}
{"prompt":"In particular during family gatherings (such as funerals), where there are different customs.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You have an opportunity, but you have not described a problem. (Are you creating one?) Many families have various members who have different spiritual beliefs and religious practices. Accepting the idea that those with whom we are close may be different from us is the only way to create a world of peace.  This may be a wonderful opportunity to practice tolerance and love. If mutual decisions need to be made in religious contexts, you may also get to practice boundary setting, assertiveness (without aggression), communication skills, and loving kindness. This is a great problem to work through! It is indeed a very spiritual question. Blessings to you all, ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org) END"}
{"prompt":"She is busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We do not talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we do not know how.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other (even if it needs to be on the phone). Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside. That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you.As far as your little fights, consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are open-ended (cannot be answered with just yes or no) and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing. Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch. It is also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated. Think of the same for your girlfriend. This could be a great discussion to have as well. END"}
{"prompt":"I am a teenager. My dad has been jail for the last five years. It is tough, but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters, my brother, and I. I feel like I took upon a parent role when I am the second youngest, and I am not stable. My mother and sisters say I am overdramatic. I am just so hurt, and I keep breaking down.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Each person handles themselves differently in any situation.Since you are willing to speak about how you feel, keep looking for blogs and forums on whatever topics you feel most describe your current circumstance.Your mother and sister, even though they are family seem to prefer the opposite method to yours.Find your own path of supportive other people and possibly a therapist.This way you will have understanding and validation which your mom and sister do not want to give you right now.

{"prompt":"I am a teenage girl. I have been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I do not remember anything about this dream. I still know that it is the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember. END"}
{"prompt":"How does a person start the counseling process?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Honestly, do not :(Talk with your close friends, first (y'know, the ones you actually can tell sh*t to, not the more surface level ones, god-bless-their-souls...Be with your family; should you have a fine relationship with them, tell them and utilize them; they gave you life and that bond (especially between a mother and son) is unbreakable.Go with your faith; as often as various faiths have been blasted and lambasted around the world, understand that they are ultimately trying to get you closer to God :) And, are not that a big thing.Go with those around you FIRST that actually MIGHT GIVE A CR*P about you, FIRST, before going to a total stranger you have never met before, that is just as damaged, stupid, and imperfect as we all are.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternativeand healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away. END"}
{"prompt":"My husband had an emotional affair with his ex-wife in November. She invited him to dinner, alone, with their daughter. I was not aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was. He had been drinking, and I told him not to come home that night. The next morning, we talked about going to counseling. He went out that night with friends and said his ex-wife was not going. I found out in April that she did go. I gave him the chance to get everything out in the open. I found out that he stayed that second night with her. I asked if they slept in the same bed, and he said yes, both nights. His daughter was not there the second night. He claims they did not have sex, but what else should I think?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I agree with you that professional counseling is a wise choice for your relationship.Your husband may not know, want to know or want to discuss with you, what his true feelings are toward you and the ex.The topic is very heated, which is why discussing these matters alone may do more harm than good,Usually people start deeply complex emotional matters discussion and get so upset the conversation goes off track and unintended hurts happen.In a therapist office, the two of you will be guided on talking about these critical areas and this will be much more productive than trying to do so only with the two of you.

{"prompt":"My dad is always, and I mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. He makes me feel stupid. He also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. Is this abuse?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am really sorry to hear that you are going through this.It is a little difficult to answer your question because the laws that define child abuse are different from state to state. But usually, things like what you describe your dad is doing are not considered to be child abuse.The more important thing is how you feel about what is going on. It sounds like this is really bothering you.If you do not think you can talk to your dad about how you feel, you might want to try talking to another adult you trust (like a family member or teacher). They may be able to help you figure out some ways to communicate with your dad.I think you might feel better if you can talk to someone about how your are feeling. END"}
{"prompt":"I do not know what is with me. I am almost constantly angry. Even when I am happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they did not, it infuriates me. Something perfectly normal can make me go off. When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. It is like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Nashville, I am glad you want this to be different. It does not feel good to be angry all the time, and it is stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I am sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It is likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we have simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that.So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you would rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that is the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it is that you cannot stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it is on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with. You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :) END"}
